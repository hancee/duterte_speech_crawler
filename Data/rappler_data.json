Rappler has typed the text as written in the document, including some typographical errors. STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES ON THE JURISDICTION OF  THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT March 13, 2018 Enshrined in the Constitution is the fundamental provision that protects a person of not being deprived of his life, liberty, or property without due process of law, to wit: \u201cSECTION 1. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.\u201d (Section 1, Article III, Constitution) Due process of law has been defined as a process that hears before it condemns. It affords the accused the opportunity to be heard, to be informed of the nature of the offense charged, and a reasonable time to prepare for his defense. The Constitution expressly gives the mantle of protection to a person charged and commands that: \u201cSection 14 (1). No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law.\u201d (Section 14 (1), Article III, Constitution) For a person to be charged with a criminal offense, there must be a law that shall specify a particular act as criminal with an imposition of a corresponding penalty \u2013 thus the latim maxim: \u201cNullum crimen sine lege\u201d \u201cThere is no crime without a law making it so. One cannot be punished for doing something that is not prohibited by law.\u201d A person cannot invoke as a defense that he is ignorant of the law that penalizes a particular criminal act hence the basic legal principle, that: \u201cIgnorantia juris non excusat or ignorantia legis neminem excusot\u201d \u201cIgnorance of the law excuses no one from compliance therewith.\u201d \u201cDura lex, sed lex.\u201d \u201cThe law may be harsh, but it is the law.\u201d A penal law to be enforceable must be effective. In our jurisdiction, it must be published in the Official Gazette within a certain period of time from its signing into law. An unenforceable law cannot vest jurisdiction on courts to try a charged person. The courts must first acquire jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the person of a defendant. No law or a statute lacking in the required publication can vest any court of jurisdiction over the person of a defendant because it will violate the constitutional injunction that the person so charged must be informed of the nature of his offense. Thus, the Constitution states: \u201cSECTION 14 (2). In all criminal prosecution the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, xxxx, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, xxxx.\u201d (Section 14(2), Article III, Constitution) How can the accused be informed of the nature of the offense, if he is not aware of the same because the law penalizing the act he is being charged with has not seen the light of day by way of a publication as required by law? In our jurisdiction, our country adopts the generally accepted principles of international law \u2013 and in fact they are deemed to be part of the law of the land, to wit: \u201cSECTION 2. The Philippines xxxx adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land xxxx.\u201d (Section 2, Article II, Constitution) The constitutional provision above-quoted however is not absolute as any principle of international law even if generally accepted, if it contravenes our Constitution, cannot supplant nor diminish the Philippine Constitution. Domestic laws are supreme over international law unless the former are violative of internationally recognized principles of justice. At the same time, \u201c[t]reaties become part of the law of the land through transformation pursuant to Article VII, Section 21 of the 1987 Constitution which provides that \u2018[n]o treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the members of the Senate.\u2019\u201d Given that a treaty or an international agreement has the force and effect of a law, the same cannot also go against the Constitution. Otherwise, such treaty or international agreement may be invalidated for being unconstitutional. In this regard, the Supreme Court, by virtue of Section 5 (2), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, has been given the authority to rule upon the constitutionality or validity of any treaty and international agreement. Having laid the foregoing predicate, in relation to the preliminary examination being conducted by the International Criminal Court Special Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, which she explained by saying that: \u201cThe preliminary examination of the situation in the Philippines will analyze crime allegedly committed in the State Court since at least 1 July 2016, in the context of the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 campaign launched by the government of the Philippines. Specifically, it has been alleged that since 1 July 2016, thousands of persons have been killed for reasons related to their alleged involvement in illegal drugs use or dealing. While some of such killings have reportedly occurred in the context of clashes between or within gangs, it is alleged that many of the reported incidents involved extra-judicial killings in the court of police authority operations.\u201d And while the International Criminal Court\u2019s Special Prosecutor states that: \u201cxxxx I emphasize that a preliminary examination is not an investigation but a process of examining the information available in order to reach a fully informed determination whether there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation pursuant to the criteria established by the Rome Statute xxx.\u201d I was appalled however by the fact that she has to make public announcements of the preliminary examination she is conducting thereby giving the false impression that the International Criminal Court has already acquired jurisdiction \u2013 or that the International Criminal Court will be acquiring jurisdiction, when she knows that before the International Criminal Court can acquire jurisdiction over me, it must be first firmly established that the state of the national being subject of the investigation is unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute the national for the crime of genocide; crimes against humanity; war crimes and crime of aggressions. The Special Prosecutor is also aware that national jurisdictions have the primary responsibility to investigate and prosecute those responsible for international crimes \u2013 as in her public declaration she recognized such basic principle, thus, she stated: \u201cxxx Under the Rome Statute, national jurisdiction has the primary responsibility to investigate and prosecute those responsible for international crimes, xxx.\u201d Moreover, the International Criminal Court\u2019s Special Prosecutor is likewise aware that before placing the national under investigation, she must first reconsider issues of whether or not the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over the person or the subject-matter complained of; whether or not the evidence submitted to it in relation thereto passes the rules on admissibility; and whether or not it is in the interest of justice that she makes such determination as shown in her public statement, to wit: \u201cxxx Specifically, under Article 53 (1) of the Rome Statute, I, as Prosecutor, must consider issues of jurisdiction, admissibility and interest of justice in making this determination.\u201d Given these foregoing considerations I cannot help but believe that the International Criminal Court\u2019s Special Prosecutor\u2019s premature public statements was intended to foist to the world that I am being subjected now to an investigation for crimes falling under the International Criminal Court\u2019s jurisdiction. To my mind, the Special Prosecutor commended the preliminary examination in the wrong foot by picturing me as one who most likely has committed any of the crimes punishable under the Rome Statute violating therefore the presumption of innocence guaranteed me by our Constitution. Let us tackle the questions on jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, assuming that the preliminary examination ripens into an informed determination that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation pursuant to the criteria established by the Rome Statute. Does the International Criminal Court have jurisdiction over the subject matter? The answer must be in the negative. The jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is limited to the most serious of crimes in the international community a.) crime of genocide b.) crime against humanity c.) war crimes and d.) crime of aggression. The crime of genocide cannot be said to be applicable because the act must be committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical, racial or religious group as such: The so-called war against drugs is lawfully directed against drug lords and pushers who have for many years destroyed the present generation specially the youth. The deaths resulting in the process of making lawful arrests arising from the violent resistance of the suspects that endangered the lives of the police officers cannot be said to have been committed against a national, ethical, racial or religious group. Nor can they be considered crimes against humanity because the deaths is a direct result of a lawful exercise of a police duty, and under our criminal law, is a justifying circumstance that removes from the police officer criminal culpability, the same being an exercise of self-defense. The killing of the suspects cannot be said to be murder as there is no intent to kill rather an instinct exercise of self-preservation. The campaign against illegal drugs does not also fall within the purview of a war crime because of the absence of the element of armed conflict, whether international or domestic. The campaign against illegal drugs may not also be deemed as a crime of aggression because of the absence of the element of intention to control or direct the political or military action of another State. What about the International Criminal Court\u2019s jurisdiction over my person? Does the International Criminal Court have jurisdiction? The answer again must be in the negative for following reasons: In our jurisdiction, it is required that a law before it takes effect, the same must be either published in the Official Gazette or in a newspapers of general circulation. On August 30, 2011, the Philippine Senate ratified the treaty in the matter of the enforcement of the Rome Statute between the Philippine Government and the United Nations. Official record particularly the Official Gazette, the Rome Statute or the law by which I am now being subjected to a preliminary examination was not published thereat. Neither is there any showing that the said Rome Statute was ever published in a newspaper of general circulation. There being no jurisdiction of the said law, it stands to reason that the Rome Statute cannot be enforceable in the Philippines hence the International Criminal Court has not acquired jurisdiction nor can it acquire jurisdiction over my person. Article 126 (Entry into force) of the Rome Statute providing that it becomes in effect on the first day of the month after the 60th day following the date of the deposit of the 60th instrument of ratification with the Secretary-General, to wit: \u201cArticle 126 Entry into force cannot prevail over our domestic law, the New Civil Code, that requires the publication of a law in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation to make it effective and enforceable, to wit: \u201cARTICLE 2. Laws shall take effect after fifteen days following the completion of their publication either on the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines, unless it is otherwise provided,\u201d In the leading case of Lorenzo M. Ta\u00f1ada, Abraham F. Sarmiento, Movement of Attorneys For Brotherhood, Integrity and National [MABINI], Petitioners, V. Mon Juan C. Tuvera, in His Capacity As Executive Assistant To The President, Hon. Joaquin Venus, In His Capacity As Deputy Executive Assistant To The President, Melquiades P. De La Cruz In His Capacity As Director, Bureau of Printing, Respondents; the Supreme Court ruled: \u201cDue process was invoked by the petitioners in demanding the disclosure of a number of presidential decrees which they claimed was not published as required by law. The government argued that while publication was necessary as a rule, it was so when it was \u201cotherwise provided\u201d, as when the decrees themselves declared that they are to become effective immediately upon their approval. In the decision of this case on April 24, 1988, the Court affirmed the necessity for the publication of some of these decrees, declaring in the dispositive position as follows: WHEREFORE, the Court hereby orders respondents to publish in the Official Gazette all unpublished presidential issuances which are of general application, and unless so published, they shall have no binding force and effect.\u201d \u201cPublication is indispensable in every case, but the legislature may in its discretion provide that the usual fifteen-day period shall be shortened or extended.xxxx\u201d \u201cIt is not correct to say that under the disputed clause publication may be dispersed with altogether. The reason is that such omission would offend due process insofar as it would deny the public knowledge of the laws that are supposed to govern the legislation could validly provide xxxx.\u201d \u201cIt is unlikely that persons not aware of it would be prejudiced as a result and they would be so not because of a failure to comply with but simply because they did not know of its existence. Significantly, this is not true only if penal laws as it is commonly supposed. One can think of many non-penal measures, like a law on prescription, which must also be communicated to the persons they may affect before they can begin to operate.\u201d \u201cWe note at this point the conclusive presumption that every person knows the law which of course presupposes that the law has been published if the presumption is to have any legal justification at all. It is no less important to remember that Section 6 of the Bill of Rights recognizes the \u201cright of the people to information on matters of public concern and this certainly applies to among others, and indeed specially the legislative enactments of the government.\u201d \u201cWe hold therefore that all statutes, including those of local application and private laws, shall be published as a condition for their effectivity, which shall begin fifteen days after publication unless different effective date is fixed by the legislature.\u201d \u201cWe agree that publication must be in full or it is no publication at all since its purpose is to inform the public of the content of the laws. As correctly pointed out by the petitioners, the mere mention of the number of the presidential decree, the title of such a decree, its whereabouts xxx the supposed date of effectivity, and in a mere supplement of the Official Gazette cannot satisfy the publication requirement.\u201d \u201cLaws must come out in the open in the clear light of the sun instead of skulking in the shadows with their dark deep secrets. Mysterious pronouncements and rumored rules cannot be recognized as binding unless their existence and contents are confirmed by a valid publication intended to make full disclosure and give proper notice to the people. The furtive law is likely a scabbarded saber that cannot persist parry or out unless that naked blade is drawn.\u201d Moreover, the ICC cannot subject the President of the Philippines to any investigation during his tenure following the doctrine of the immunity from suit of the President while in office. The immunity doctrine of the President is a basic constitutional doctrine that has been consitently upheld by the Supreme Court. While the said immunity is not explicitly stated in the 1987 Constitution, its framers unanimously agree that such doctrine is deemed written in the 1987 Constitution. Thus, considering that such immunity is part and parcel of the organic law of the Philippines, it cannot be removed through the enactment of a statute or be bargained away through the negotiation of a treaty. In so far as Article 27 of the Rome Statute provides for the irrelevance of official capacity, in that \u201c[i]mmunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiciton over such a person,\u201d the Rome Statute once again is violative of the 1987 Constitution. Therefore, as regards the Philippines, the President during the period of his tenure, can never be subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC. EFFECTS OF BELATED PUBLICATION It may be that the International Criminal Court\u2019s Special Prosecutor or the International Criminal Court itself having been informed by the glaring and fatal error of lack of publication of the Rome Statute would now cause the publication of the aforesaid law thereafter, the question arises: Would the belated publication cure the mistake and place my person under its jurisdiction? The answer cannot be in the affirmative. The Constitution provides that no ex post facto law shall be enacted, stated differently it means that one cannot be prosecuted for acts committed before the effectivity of the law that makes those acts criminal. The International Criminal Court does not have retroactive jurisdiction. It may only consider crimes committed after the Rome Statute has come to force. Since the Rome Statute is deemed to be ineffective and enforceable by reason of the lack of publication required by our domestic law, necessarily, it cannot acquire jurisdiction over any person as the acts complained of were committed prior to its effectivity. PHILIPPINES WITHDRAWING AS SIGNATORY IN THE ROME STATUTE At the onset of my presidency, there appears to be a systematic assault by the United Nations as well as its special rapporteurs not only on my person but on my administration as well, more particularly on the relentless campaign against the proliferation of illegal drugs industry in the country. Special rapporteur Agnes Callamard, without proof, and merely relying on news reports and accusations from my critics, have embarked on a campaign against me before the international public and has pictured me as a ruthless violator of human rights and directly responsible for the deaths of its suspects which she describes as extra-judicial killings. Recently, two Filipino United Nations special rapporteurs, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz and Cecilia Jimenez-Damary made public announcements effectively accusing the Philippine government of human rights abuses, killings, and attacks being carried by members of the armed forces against the indigenous communities. The United Nations High Commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, has joined the United Nations special rapporteurs in maligning my person by saying that I should submit myself to psychiatric examination. He likewise accused me of attacking the \u201cspecial rapporteur of committing \u201cwidespread extra-judicial executions\u201d and engaging in \u201con-going attacks against voices who are critical of the current appointment, including human rights defender.\u201d As stated earlier, the International Criminal Court\u2019s Special Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda gave a premature public announcement of a preliminary examination thereby creating the impression that I am likely to be charged before the International Criminal Court violating therefore the presumption of innocence accorded me by the Constitution. The accusations of these United Nations officials have the effect of painting me guilty before the eyes of the world. There appears to be a concerted effort on those aforesaid United Nation officials to paint me as a ruthless and heartless violator of human rights. When the Philippine government made itself a signatory to the Rome Statute, it was on the assumption that the internationally accepted principles of justice in relation to our Constitutional requirement on due process will be upheld. Given the baseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks on my person as well as against my administration, engineered by the officials of the United Nations, as well as the attempt by the International Criminal Court special prosecutor to place my person within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, in violation of due process and the presumption of innocence expressly guaranteed by the Philippine Constitution and recognized no less by the Rome Statute, I therefore declare and forthwith give notice, as President of the Republic of the Philippines, that the Philippines is withdrawing its ratification of the Rome Statute effective immediately. I also give notice that Article 127 of the Rome Statute providing that: \u201cArticle 127 Withdrawal is not applicable in so far as the effectivity of the withdrawal of the Philippines as a signatory to the Rome Statute is concerned, for the reason that there appears to be fraud in entering into such agreement. The Philippines in ratifying the Rome Statute was made to believe that the principle of complementarity shall be observed; that the principle of due process and the presumption of innocence as mandated by our Constitution and the Rome Statute shall prevail; and that the legal requirement of publication to make the Rome Statute enforceable shall be maintained. In addition, it is worthy to note that out of the five (5) permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, only France and the United Kingdom are State Parties to the Rome Statute, While the United States signed the Rome Statute on December 30, 2000, then President William Jefferson Clinton refused to submit the Rome Statute to the Senate of the United States for ratification because of serious concerns, among others, on the possibility of politicized prosecutions, and even recommended that his successor defer such submission until such time that said concerns are properly addressed. Thereafter, on May 6, 2002, the United States, under the administration of then President George H.W. Bush, transmitted a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, stating that \u201cthe United States does not intend to become a party to the treaty.\u201d In line with the politicization of the ICC, Burundi withdrew from the ICC effective October 27, 2017 because \u201c[t]he ICC has shown itself to be a political instrument and weapon used by the west to enslave [other states].\u201d The actuations and statement of the UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al-Hussein readily show international bias and refusal of some sectors of the international community to support the Philippine\u2019s legitimate efforts at self-determination, nation building and independence from foreign influence and control. Coupled with the implication of culpability that the preliminary examination by the Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda unduly and maliciously created, it is apparent that the ICC is being utilized as a political tool against the Philippines. Given that the ICC shows a propensity for failing to give due respect to the State Parties of the Rome Statute and that there is clear bias on the part of the UN against the Philippines, the Philippines may very well consider withdrawing from the Rome Statute. As demonstrated above, the very considerations upon which the Philippines agreed to be a signatory to the Rome Statute have not been observed nor complied with hence the Philippines hereby withdraws from the Rome Statute.  RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE \u2013 Rappler.com"}, "https://www.rappler.com/nation/full-text-president-rodrigo-duterte-inaugural-speech": {"Title": "FULL TEXT: President Rodrigo Duterte's inaugural speech", "Release Date": "JUN 30, 2016 1:30 PM PHT", "Extract Date": "November 29, 2020 17:18:55", "Transcript": "Jun 30, 2016 1:30 PM PHT MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Rodrigo Roa Duterte took his oath of office as the 16th president of the Philippines at noon on Thursday, June 30. The first Mindanaoan to become the country's Chief Executive, the former mayor of Davao City, made good his promise to \"spell out my governance in 5 minutes\" before hundreds of guests at Malaca\u00f1ang's Rizal Hall and on national TV. In his inaugural speech, Duterte reiterated his call for change, the running theme of his campaign. \"Change must start with us and in us... We have become our own worst enemies, and we must have the courage and the will to change ourselves.\" Professing love for the Filipino people, he ended his speech with this note:\"Why am I here? Because I am ready to start my work for the nation.\" Here is the full text of his speech, which Duterte delivered in English. *** President Fidel Ramos, sir, salamat po sa tulong mo making me President; President Joseph Ejercito Estrada; Senate President Franklin Drilon and the members of the Senate; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte and the members of the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court; His Excellency Guiseppe Pinto and the members of the Diplomatic Corps; incoming members of the Cabinet; fellow workers in government; my fellow countrymen. No leader, however strong, can succeed at anything of national importance or significance unless he has the support and cooperation of the people he is tasked to lead and sworn to serve. It is the people from whom democratic governments draw strength and this administration is no exception. That is why we have to listen to the murmurings of the people, feel their pulse, supply their needs and fortify their faith and trust in us whom they elected to public office. There are many amongst us who advance the assessment that the problems that bedevil our country today which need to be addressed with urgency, are corruption, both in the high and low echelons of government, criminality in the streets, and the rampant sale of illegal drugs in all strata of Philippine society and the breakdown of law and order. True, but not absolutely so. For I see these ills as mere symptoms of a virulent social disease that creeps and cuts into the moral fiber of Philippine society. I sense a problem deeper and more serious than any of those mentioned or all of them put together. But of course, it is not to say that we will ignore them because they have to be stopped by all means that the law allows. Erosion of faith and trust in government \u2013 that is the real problem that confronts us. Resulting therefrom, I see the erosion of the people\u2019s trust in our country\u2019s leaders; the erosion of faith in our judicial system; the erosion of confidence in the capacity of our public servants to make the people\u2019s lives better, safer and healthier. Indeed ours is a problem that dampens the human spirit. But all is not lost. I know that there are those who do not approve of my methods of fighting criminality, the sale and use of illegal drugs and corruption. They say that my methods are unorthodox and verge on the illegal. In response let me say this: I have seen how corruption bled the government of funds, which were allocated for the use in uplifting the poor from the mire that they are in. I have seen how illegal drugs destroyed individuals and ruined family relationships. I have seen how criminality, by means all foul, snatched from the innocent and the unsuspecting, the years and years of accumulated savings. Years of toil and then, suddenly, they are back to where they started. Look at this from that perspective and tell me that I am wrong. In this fight, I ask Congress and the Commission on Human Rights and all others who are similarly situated to allow us a level of governance that is consistent to our mandate. The fight will be relentless and it will be sustained. As a lawyer and a former prosecutor, I know the limits of the power and authority of the president. I know what is legal and what is not. My adherence to due process and the rule of law is uncompromising. You mind your work and I will mind mine. \u201cMalasakit;\u201d \u201cTunay naPagbabago; Tinud-anay (real)nga Kausaban(change)\u201d[applause]\u2013 these are words which catapulted me to the presidency. These slogans were conceptualized not for the sole purpose of securing the votes of the electorate. \u201cTinud-anay nga kabag-uhan (real change). Mao kana ang tumong sa atong pang-gobyerno (this is the direction of our government).\u201d Far from that. These were battle cries articulated by me in behalf of the people hungry for genuine and meaningful change. But the change, if it is to be permanent and significant, must start with us and in us. To borrow the language of F. Sionil Jose, we have become our own worst enemies. And we must have the courage and the will to change ourselves. Love of country, subordination of personal interests to the common good, concern and care for the helpless and the impoverished \u2013 these are among the lost and faded values that we seek to recover and revitalize as we commence our journey towards a better Philippines.The ride will be rough. But come and join me just the same. Together, shoulder to shoulder, let us take the first wobbly steps in this quest. There are two quotations from revered figures that shall serve as the foundation upon which this administration shall be built. \u201cThe test of government is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide for those who have little.\u201d \u2013 Franklin Delano Roosevelt And from (Abraham) Lincoln I draw this expression: \u201cYou cannot strengthen the weak byweakening the strong;You cannot helpthe poor by discouraging the rich; Youcannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer; You cannot further the brotherhood by inciting class hatred among men.\u201d My economic and financial, political policies are contained in those quotations, though couched in general terms. Read between the lines. I need not go into specifics now. They shall be supplied to you in due time. However, there are certain policies and specifics of which cannot wait fortomorrowto be announced. Therefore, I direct all department secretaries and the heads of agencies to reduce requirements and the processing time of all applications,from the submission to the release. I order all department secretaries and heads of agencies to remove redundant requirements and compliance with one department or agency, shall be accepted as sufficient for all. I order all department secretaries and heads of agencies to refrain from changing and bending the rules government contracts, transactions and projects already approved and awaiting implementation.Changing the rules when the game is on-going is wrong. I abhor secrecy and instead advocate transparencyin all government contracts, projects and business transactions from submission of proposals to negotiation to perfection and finally, to consummation. Do them and we will work together.Do not do them, we will part sooner than later. On the international front and community of nations, let me reiterate that the Republic of the Philippines will honor treaties and international obligations. On the domestic front, my administration is committed to implement all signed peace agreements in step with constitutional and legal reforms. I am elated by the expression of unity among our Moro brothers and leaders, and the response of everyone else to my call for peace. I look forward to the participation of all other stakeholders, particularly our indigenous peoples, to ensure inclusivity in the peace process. Let me remind in the end of this talk, that I was elected to the presidency to serve the entire country. I was not elected to serve the interests of any one person or any group or any one class. I serve every one and not only one. That is why I have adapted as an article of faith, the following lines written by someone whose name I could no longer recall. He said: \u201cI have no friends to serve, I have no enemies to harm.\u201d Prescinding therefrom, I now ask everyone, and I mean everyone, to join me as we embark on this crusade for a better and brightertomorrow. But before I end, let me express to the nations, on behalf of the people, our condolences to the Republic of Turkey of what has happened in the place. We offer our deepest condolences. Why am I here? Hindi kasali ito diyan.The past tense was, I am here because I love my country and I love the people of the Philippines. I am here. Why? Because I am ready to start my work for the nation.

For it is not the eagle in the fight but the fight in the eagle that matters.[applause]Believe me, I will end my term fighting. It has been three years since I took my oath of office, and it pains me to say that we have not learned our lesson. The illegal drug problem persists. Corruptioncontinues and emasculates the courage we need to sustain our moral recovery initiatives. Years ago, we saw the terrible devastation caused by illegal drugs. On May 23, 2017, our law enforcers launched an operation to serve a warrant and to neutralize terrorists. A group of armed men with sophisticated weaponry and aided by locals radicalized by extremist dogma and teachings fought our troops for weeks.During thatMarawi Siege,tons ofshabuworthmillions and millions of pesos. Drug money killed 175 and wounded [2,101] of my soldiers and policemen in that five-month battle. I am aware that we still have a long way to go in our fight against this social menace. Let the reason why I advocate the imposition of the death penalty for crimes related to illegal drugs. Our citizens have begun to do their part in the war against drugs, and through the barangay formation of anti-drug councils, and also actually surrendering bricks ofcocaine found floating in the sea into our islands. I call this responsibility. However, the drugs will not be crushed unless we continue to eliminate corruption that allows this social monster to survive. I respectfully request Congress to reinstate the death penalty for heinous crimes[applause]related to drugs, as well as plunder. My countrymen, it is a sad commentary that we cannot distinguish our need from our greed, our principles from our prejudices, the real from the fake, and the truth from a lie. The reason is because that many of us, what matters above all is the \u201cself.\u201d It is selfishness [at] its worst for no purpose other than personal aggrandizement. To borrow the language of F.SionilJose, we have not risen above and beyond the parochial interests. Our warped loyalty to family, friends and tribal kin continue to exact a heavy toll on our programs designed to uplift the poor and reassure our investors, our foreign investors local, and the business sector in this country. The recent uncovering of the massive fraud perpetrated against the public health insurance system proves that corruption is pervasive. Huge amounts of medical funds were released to cover padded medical claims and imaginary treatment of ghost patients. I am grossly disappointed. The government is conned of millions of pesos which could be used to treat illnesses and possibly save the lives of many. Thus I ordered the NBI to arrest and cause the prosecution of those liable. I appointed a new PhilHealth President, whom I know is a man of integrity, a military man, a former military officer, and gave him marching orders to prioritize ridding the agency of corruption. By the way, I commend the Bureau of Investigation for its handling ofhigh profilecases resulting in the arrest and prosecution of criminals. These culprits will have their day of reckoning in court. I hope it happens during the last three years of my term. Concerning the unscrupulous persons manning our ports and scalawags in uniform, we have been unyielding in our reforms to weed them out of public service. I have fired or caused the resignation of more than a hundred officials and appointees of government without regard to relationship, friendship and alliance. There is no sacred cow, as the saying goes, in my Administration. Institutions that are the stewards of our resources and agents of development have long been a major source of public frustration. Drastic reforms within these agencies have yielded results. Our government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), infamous for high salaries and bonuses being paid their executives and employees, have started to shape up.As of July 9, 2019, we collected more than P61 billion from GOCCs or government corporations, 32% of which, or P16 billion,from PAGCOR.[applause]This is more than the P36 billion collected in 2017. My salute to Andrea Domingo.[applause]Magpasugal ka pa, ma\u2019am, nang marami.[laughter]Bureau of Customs, though corruption-ridden, managed to collect Five HundredEighty FiveBillion Pesos (P585,000,000,000) in 2018. Imagine how much more could have been collected had the BOC been clean and less corrupt. May I cut and just --- magsalita lang ako kung anong sa isip ko. I went to the Bureau of Customs two weeks ago and found out that there were about 63 of them facing charges, criminal charges, and 61 of them under investigation. I hope that I can have the cooperation of Congress if we cannot abolish their position. And if I cannot dismiss them for the reason that there is a security of tenure, I will just allow them to have their plantilla positions but they have to report to Congress everyday to help me in the huge paperwork that we have to do everyday. All of them will go out from the premises of the Customs area.[applause]I do not want them back. We, in government, talk too much, act too little, and too slow. I recall saying that before the Congressional hearing when I was Mayor of Davao City. I say that again to emphasize how little we have changed since then. We are long onrhetoricsbut short on accomplishments. It\u2019s either you Congress or --- even the Executive department and maybe me. So I am here to rectify my own error. That is why, I implore those who occupy positions of power and authority, to let your deeds and accomplishments do the talking. Lead by example. Words ring hollow when not followed by positive and prioritized action. Time and again, I have emphasized that like my fellow workers in government, trabahante lang po ako ng Pilipino. Last year, I assign --- I signed the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act, a significant piece of legislation to improve service delivery and fight corruption, still until now.  However, much [has]to be done in ensuring our responsiveness to the people\u2019s needs. Based on complaints received by the Contact Center [ng] Bayan, Contact Center [ng] Bayan --- that\u2019s in my office --- the LTO, SSS, BIR, LRA, and PAG-IBIG are the top five agencies that need to drastically improve their service. I reiterate my government --- my directive to the government and instrumentalities, including the LGUs and the government corporations:simplify. May I\u2026 Nandito ba kayo? Simplify. Just like the others. You can do it electronically. You do not have to go to the office.  I\u2019ve been asking that from you since three years ago. \u2018Pag hindi pa ninyo nagawa \u2018yan ngayon, papatayin ko talaga kayo.[applause]Nabubwisit na\u2026 Simplify and make your services responsive to ---client-friendly. Your client is the Filipino, our employer --- from where the money in our pockets come from, from our salaries. Thanks to Executive SecretaryMedialdea, we have increased the number of lines [for] Hotline 8888 to make it more responsive to the public. Our ultimate goal is for our people to be freed from using these hotlines because government service and response have markedly improved. Again, I will\u2026 Ang problema kasi ng Fili --- I\u2019m addressing now to the Filipino. Kayo rin kasi sinasabi ko na sa inyo, be assertive. At \u2018pag kayo o ikaw hiningian more than the required payment by government at humingi pa sa iyo, I\u2019ve been telling you mag-eskandalo kayo sa opisina. Make a scene. Sampalin mo \u2018yang p***** i** na \u2018yan.[laughter]Kasi aabot rin sa akin \u2018yan.[applause] And I have done that. Ako mag-prangka ako sa inyo, ako lang ang Presidente na hanggang ngayon nagbubugbog talaga ng tao diyan sa loob ng Malaca\u00f1ang. Pinapakain ko ng pera \u2018yang mga y*** na \u2018yan. Eh galit na ako sa inyo eh. Kindly be assertive. Pagka hiningian ka, sabihin mo, \u201cT*** *** mo. Sabi ni Duterte, the President told us, that if you extort money from me, I will slap you.\u201d  At sampalin talaga ninyo. Hindi na bale magkaaway. I will defend you. At kung maaari and this is what I\u2019ve been doing all along. There\u2019s an [8888]. Be sure that it is true. Though you are not liable for libel pero huwag naman \u2018yang makasakit ka ng kapwa-tao na wala namang kasalanan. [8888], then place \u201cTo President Duterte, re: abuses by the director asking for money.\u201d Text mo, lalabas \u2018yan diyan. And that is for the public to view. At kung totoo, Malaca\u00f1an, I said, is open 24 hours --- 24 hours basta corruption. And that is why that fiasco about the frigate ni Trillanes was because \u2018yung Koreano na napagbili ng barko, who sold the ship to the Philippine government, wala pa hong delivery. And it was there already ready. And that is why that Korean went to Malaca\u00f1an just to complain why is it that there is no request for delivery. So I told Bong, \u201cBong, ayusin mo \u2018yan.\u201d He went to Lorenzana and Lorenzana nagsulat siya. May nakakuha because sa Malaca\u00f1an, every administration may tao \u2018yan diyan. Every administration leaves some of the men because they are appointed on plantilla position. Eh kinuha nila then it was brought here, before the Congress. And so Bong was called to testify. And he said, he was assured it will be a closed-door. I told Bong, \u201cNo, ask for an open and public hearing.\u201d  Sabi ko, \u201cSabihin mo sa lahat --- wala --- you have nothing. Just say the truth.\u201d Sabi ko, pagkatapos niya testify, sabi ko, \u201cBong, maniwala ka hindi, you will be a senator.\u201d[applause]Totoo \u2018yan. That is the story of how convoluted politics and corruption here in our country works.  Equipped with political will, the government ordered the closure of Boracay Island for six months to prevent its further deterioration. We cleaned and rehabilitated the island and I allowed it to heal naturally. I am proud to say that it has been restored close to its original pristine state. Boracay Inter-Agency Task Force led by SecretaryCimatu, and fully supported by SecretariesA\u00f1o, Romulo-Puyat --- Oh what\u2019s her name? Puro surname ito, Romulo-Puyat. What\u2019s her name? Ah si --- ah Berna. Ah, Berna Romulo-Puyat, Bello andVillar, and then TESDA ChiefMamondiongfor this huge success. Kudos are also due to the PMS for integrating the six-month Rehabilitation Plan, and the NEDA for therecently-approved[Medium]-term Boracay Action Plan.[applause]  Boracay Island is just the beginning. And the girls there, the foreigners are waiting for you gentlemen to visit the place. They are all on the beach sunbathing. You are invited to --- I have not been there. Alam mo, nung naayos \u2018yan, day before we were told that there\u2019s gonna be an opening tomorrow. So on the TV on that day, Magandang Hapon, showed a lot of buntings and banners, \u201cSalamat Duterte.\u201d So when I saw it, I called the military and the police, \u201cRemove the buntings. I am not going there.\u201d No need to really arbi --- ah advertise. I am paid for what I\u2019m doing. Nakokornihan ako. Too much adulation, bordering pretentions.I can always smell it amile away. And I never went there until now. What I did was I went to the other side of the island and asked the DAR, \u201cWhat is the status of the land behind the beach of Boracay?\u201d And they are still categorized as forestal and agriculture. \u201cNot\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cNot commercial?\u201d \u201cNo, sir.\u201d So I told the Agrarian Reform, \u201cGo to the place, have it inspected because I will declare the whole of the island a land reform program.\u201d And I gave the islands piece by piece to the Atis, the natives of the place para walang masabi. Marami kasi ginawa ko raw[applause]para linisan ko, ibigay ko sa mga kaibigan ko.  Wala akong kaibigang mayaman. Ayaw kong kaibigan ng mayaman because pagka mayaman ka, tatabi ka lang sa akin, pati ako napahiran na ng kung ano-ano ang hingiin mo sa gobyerno. There are those who violate environmental rules. I am giving due notice to the LGUs and other stakeholders, kayo po, of tourist destinations to take extra steps in the enforcement of our laws and the protection of our environment.  On January 27, 2019, we officially started the Manila Bay rehabilitation. Though we have a long way to go, we are encouraged by the test results of the waters near PadreFaura. We will relocate informal settlers --- I hope it can happen during my time --- along the waterways and shut down establishments that continue to pollute and poison our waters. Make a choice. I\u2019m going to the\u2026[Malaki ba \u2018yung building diyan?]I\u2019m going to dismantle your burning --- ah building --- or just simply burn it down so that we can have a new set-up of environmental friendly, whatever that means. Through the Build, Build, Build Program in emerging economic hubs outside Metro Manila. This will swiftly gain ground, thanks to the efforts of the Economic Team led by Secretary Dominguez. Hard at work in the interconnection of our islands and cities by air, land, and sea are SecretariesTugadeandVillar. Alam naman ninyo. Magaganda na ang airport ninyo. Inuna ko nga kayo eh. Everybody\u2019s complaining about the Davao airport and I said, \u201cDavao will be the last.\u201d Kung hindi na maabutan, sabi ko mga taga-Davao, pasensya na kayo. Para walang masabi ang Congress sa atin, baka nga 3% sila doon sa kabila.  We also paved the way for the entry of third telecommunications provider. Do not worry about this. There is no corruption at all. I guarantee you, upon the grave of my father. I do not allow --- I do not talk to them. I just say: Just do your work. And kung maaari, according to what the specifications are required by this government. I challenge this new player to fulfill its commitment to provide fast and reliable telecommunication services to our people, especially in the underserved areas. DICT Secretary Honasanwill bethe lead man in this endeavor. I hope he is here.[applause]  However, developmental gains will not be felt by our people in the countryside if we cannot maintain law and order. \u2018Yang peace and security, wala \u2018yan. We need to enforce the law. After almost two decades of peace negotiation, the Bangsamoro Organic Law was finally passed and ratified.  For decades, our Muslim brothers in the ARMM have been mired in poverty. My late Muslim brother,MinDAChair AbdulKhayr Alonto, envisioned a progressive, peaceful, and united Mindanaoduringour lifetime. It is my hope that the Bangsamoro Transition will fast-track the establishment of regional government that will secure and comfortable life for Muslim brothers and sisters, and all indigenous communities in the Bangsamoro Regions. Additionally, I have taken the helm of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict and have assigned a Cabinet member to each region to harmonize government efforts in attaining national development [and] security. Through the exceptional leadership of Secretary Briones and the DepEd, I am proud to say that this year more Filipino learners are receiving basic education, with over 27 million enrollees from Kinder to Senior High School.[applause] And because we have still a little to spare, the fastest population growth, one of the --- is the Philippines. We are so industrious that we are producing more people than\u2026[laughter]I do not want to quarrel with the religious but\u2026 More than [823,000] --- sorry my eyes is not good --- for the\u2026 Isinusuot ko lang \u2018to \u2018pag mag --- paminsan-minsan eh. Out-of-school youth and adult learners were able to access non-formal education through the Alternative Learning System. For our national sports development, I support the proposed measure to create the National Academy of Sports for High School students.[applause] Almost 86,000 micro, small, and medium enterprises or the MSMEs have received over P3 billion worth of loans since 2017, thanks to the efforts of Secretary Lopez and the DTI. Additional benefits for solo parents,[applause]the assignment of health workers in all barangays, and the expansion of the Malasakit Centers, are what we also hope to achieve through the bills filed by the original concept of Bong Go.[applause]Para manalo sa kampanya, \u2018yon ang mantra niya. Totohanin mo lang, Bong, mapahiya tayong lahat.[laughter] I also implore Congress\u2026 You --- look. You have to study this very carefully. Congress has to postpone the May 2020 elections and \u2018yung Barangay, Sangguniang Kabataan to October 2022. Because if you read it, this\u2026[applause]To rectify the truncated terms. Paiba-iba na eh. The truncated terms of sitting barangays but also provide them with the ample time to finish their programs and projects. I suggest Congress should also enact the Magna Carta for Barangays.[applause] This Administration\u2019s malasakit at serbisyo program has, of course, reached the Filipinos who labor in foreign lands. The milestone signing of the Bilateral Labor Agreement with Kuwait in 2018 is a testament of my commitment to stop abuses inflicted on our overseas Filipinos. To ensure their welfare, protection and their access to government services, the establishment of the Department of Overseas Filipinos will sufficiently address this particular need.[applause] Our accomplishments for the past three years and the plans for the next three are discussed in detail in my mid-term report to the people, copies of which shall be made available before the day ends. Let me repeat what I said many times before. Honestly, I have identified the enemy who dumped us into this quagmire we are in. I have met the enemy face-to-face and sadly, the enemy is \u201cus.\u201d We are our own tormentors --- addressing the Filipino people --- we are our own demons; we are as rapacious predators preying on the helpless, the weak and the voiceless. We find corruption everywhere in government with every malefactor watching his cohort\u2019s back in blatant disregard of his oath when he assumed public office. Even the language has evolved to soften the wickedness of the criminal act. \u201cFor the Boys\u201d, \u201csponsoring an event\u201d or what-else-have-you. No amount of euphemism can trivialize or normalize betrayal of public trust or any other criminal offense. It is an injury laced with insult. It is both a national embarrassment and a national shame. For every transaction, a commission; for every action, extortion; and arequest that goes on and on \u2013 endlessly and shamelessly. Catharsis is what we, individually and collectively, need to do today \u2013 not tomorrow but today. Self-purgation followed by the resolve to do what is right and proper, is good for the nation\u2019s health. Let me ask you: When will corruption end? Kailan ba talaga \u2018to? Hanggang kailan? Well, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been in --- with government for almost 35 years now. I am not singling out myself. It\u2019s the entire gamut of our system. Corruption exasperates. It frustrates. It is also exasperating that there are times when I think that perhaps it is blood that we need to cleanse and rinse away the dirt and the muck that stick to the flesh like leeches. Of course, it is only a thought. I am simply thinking aloud. To dispel any controversy that my statements in this regard will create something else. Words of Pedro Guerrero who said, \u201cSometimes they write what I say and they write --- and they write what I say and not what I mean.\u201d So \u2018yung mga pa-purga-purga lang diyan.I use similes, metaphors, hyperbole, and other figures of speech every now and then, to prove or stress a point. I am as human as anybody else. On the matter of the Philippine --- West Philippine Sea. The avoidance of conflict --- armed conflict and protection of our territorial waters and natural resources compel us to perform a delicate balancing act. A shooting war is grief and misery multiplier. War leaves widows and orphans in its wake. I am not ready or inclined to accept the occurrence of more destruction, more widows and more orphans, should war, even on a limited scale, breaks out.More and better results can be reached in the privacy of a conference room than in a squabble in public. That is why I will do in the peaceful way, mindful of the fact that it is our national pride and territorial integrity that are at stake. Short of expressly advocating a call to arms, there are those who say that we should stand up and stop those who fish in our economic zone. Of course we will do in due time. There is\u2026 Alam mo ganito \u2018yan eh. Noong --- when I became President and when the M16 rifles were cancelled by America upon the prodding of the US Congress, I found myself in a quandary because reports were already very ripe na there was the passing of arms in Marawi. And because of the arms were already --- mostly in the hands of the police, hands-me-down from the army were quite old and sometimes the bolt that pushes the bullet flies out and the barrel has really become lose, and there are no more launch and planes to push it into a circular trajectory to maintain its accuracy. So I was forced to go to China. Eh mabuti\u2019t na lang nasabi ko sa inyo \u2018to. Then in China, we had a bilateral. I brought along the military man --- A\u00f1o, the chief of staff then, and all of them, Lorenzana, Esperon, National Security. In that meeting, I said --- Cabinet members were there --- \u201cI want to go to my territory to dig oil.\u201d That was the word, \u201cI dig.\u201d Because that is ours. Ang sabi ni President Xi, \u201cWell, you know there is a conflict there. Do you think, rather than go there and have a confrontation --- not necessarily the grey ships, war ships. But you know a squabble there could lead to something else.\u201d Sabi niya, we just became friends. And perhaps we can talk about this. But not an outright precipitate move because\u2026 He said it softly, \u201cIt can mean trouble.\u201d If the trouble comes out from the mouth of a president ofa republic, anong magawa ko? So what did I answer? \u201cWell then maybe, sir, we can talk about this at some other time.\u201d But definitely, before I go, we must talk about the West Philippine Sea. We cannot you know, have our cake and eat it too. You know, I cannot go there even to bring the Coast Guard to drive them away. China also claims the property and he is in possession. \u2018Yan ang problema. Sila \u2018yung in possession and claiming all the resources there as an owner. We are claiming the same but we are not in the position because of that fiasco noong dalawang nag-standoff doon during the time of my predecessor si Albert, ambassador. If I\u2019m correct. I do not know his real name. Tayo ang umatras. Pagsabi niya umatras, that was a kind of a compromise. Tayo ang umatras. Noong umatras tayo, pumasok sila. Marami na. That day, we lost the Spratly and the Panganiban Island. Iyan ang totoo. Walang bolahan 'yan. Ngayon, may arbitral ruling. I... I said, I could not even ask for the oil claiming the entire resources of the... Anong sabihin ko sa kanila? Kaya sinabi ko, \"Let us do this mutually.\" Of course, when Xi says, \"I will fish,\" who can prevent him? And sabi ko naman, \"We will fish because we claim it.\" And sabi ko, \"Please allow because...\" Before that, they were driving away our fishermen. 'Di ba inaabog nila?Kaya sabi ko, \"Do not drive them away because the Filipinos are of the belief that they are also --- they claim it.\" Now, if you deprive --- deprive the Filipinos of --- there, magkagulo talaga 'yan. And it could lead to ano --- not really war, and I said, \"we have to...\" Kaya ang sabi ko... When I said, \u201cI allowed,\u201d that was on the premise that I own the property. Pero hindi tayo in control of the property. Ayan magsabi sila, \"Of course, I will allow you.\" Kaya pinabalik. Eh 'yung disgrasya, 'yung pagsabi \"a mere incident --- legal, marine incident,\" \u2018yan ang ginagamit sa batas \u2018yan, \"a marine incident happened.\" Hindi naman sinasabi na \"marine accident.\" It was just nabanggan, wala naman. So they wanted to talk, tapos ayaw dito. And so, \"So sige, we will investigate and you investigate, and when you are ready, we should meet and compare notes, and let us determine who pays for what damage.\" Ganun lang. Ipadala ko 'yung marines ko to drive away the Chinese fishermen. I guarantee you, not one of them will come home alive. Kung ipadala ko 'yung limang --- pati 'yung frigate ko na bago, 'yung pinagkaguluhan nila ni Trillanes diyan sa --- that made Bong a Senator, ubos 'yan because there are already guided missiles in that island. And the fastest that they have installed there can reach Manila in seven minutes.You want war? Alam mo, asaran 'yan eh. Supladuhan 'yan. Kung supladuhan lang, murahin, \"P***** i** mo, l**** ka. Umalis ka diyan.\" Kung ganunan lang, bright ako diyan. Hanggang bunganga lang. Pero kung bunutan na ng baril, ah pwede siguro basta dalawa lang. But the problem is, there --- whether we do it in a diplomatic way, there will be heated arguments, sigurado 'yan. We do it in a confrontation doon. We try to drive them away, it could lead to a violence. Any way 'yan. By the way the President answered when I said \"I will dig my oil\" the first time I went to China. Nakita ko 'yung tao eh. So you can, more or less, draw a profile of his, \"Please do not do that because there will be trouble.\" Ano... Anong magagawa ko? I go there, I said, \"The fisheries who were...\" And besides, I was invoking 'yung traditional fishing rights. It is in that arbitral ruling. Ayaw lang ninyong gustong tignan. It is mentioned there that even before countries were in existence, people around an ocean or a lake had already been fishing there for generations. And that is why fishing rights are allowed in the so many cases between Finland and Germany, decided by UNCLOS ---UNCLOS and the International Law of the Seas. UNCLOS is a product of a treaty. That treaty is also a part of our land because we area signatory. Eh kung basahin lang ninyo 'yan nang husto, it is there. You might just\u2026 China and everybody recognizes traditional fishing rights for the natives who were there even before the creation of republics and governments. That law is a humane law. So I'm sorry I have to... I promised you 40 minutes. My God, I... You want me to stop? We can go home now.[laughter]I have exceeded my... There is the, you know, there is a time for everything. Do not believe the others because they are not my friends. They are my political enemies. They said I do not believe in God. Who says? I am a believer of a universal mind there. But[applause]I do not believe that a God so perfect would create hell for his creation. What kind of God is he? He is not my God. There is a time to --- for everything. A time to negotiate and a time to quarrel with your enemy, with your political opponents or with your wife. That is why some lives here are... And a time to antagonize and a time to make peace and a time to go to war, and a time to live and a time to die. That's Ecclesiastes 3. Our ownership of the Philippine --- West Philippine Sea is internationally recognized. However, both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Arbitral Award in the case of People --- \u201cRepublic of the Philippines vs. People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d recognize instances where another state may utilize the resources found within the coastal state\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone. The arbitral ruling even states, the one that they are charging me for violating the Constitution.... Sino gani 'yon? Suntukin lang kita diyan ngayon mabuti pa. Nandito eh.The arbitral ruling even states that the Philippines may enter into fishing agreements with other states, provided certain conditions and requisites in the UNCLOS are met. So 'yung akin, sabi niya, \"Let's go fish.\" Sabi ko, \"You have to act...\" You know, they have been there fishing since time immemorial. I think it was Adam who got the first Lapu-Lapu there. Let me assure you, that national honor and territorial integrity shall not --- shall be foremost in our mind, and when we may take the next steps in this smoldering controversy over the lines of arbitral ruling, the West Philippine Sea is ours. There is no ifs and buts. It is ours. But we have been acting,[applause]along that legal truth and line.But we have to temper it with the times and the realities that we face today. Poverty incidence fell from 27.6 percent in the first half of 2015 to 21 percent in the first half of 2018. The most important number, though, is the six million Filipinos we need to pull out from poverty. Kindly help me on this.[applause] And you know, as I said, corruption is everywhere. You are free to investigate. I don't take offense. If there is anything wrong in my department, the Executive, you are free to open the investigation anytime. You do not have to call me. Call the idiots, expose them, and send them to jail. You are helping me. Do not be... I am not... I've been a prosecutor. I know how it works. Feel free. Feel free to expose anything that is not in accordance with law. We have pursued tax reforms to fund our poverty reduction programs. I therefore implore Congress to immediately pass Package 2 of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program, or the TRABAHO Bill, which shall gradually lower the income --- corporate income tax, and rationalize and improve fiscal incentives. It will energize our MSMEs and encourage them to expand their business and hopefully generate, hopefully --- I'm missing the word hopefully para sabihin na \"you're all talk\" --- hopefully [1.4] million jobs in the coming years.The MSMC --- MSMEs hold the promise of raising a lot of the Filipinos. I therefore believe that it is now time for Congress to approve a new version of the Salary Standardization Law. Ngayon na.[applause]And to the teachers, alam mo dito who toil and work tirelessly to educate our young. Kasali na po dito 'yung hinihingi ninyo. Hindi naman masyadong malaki, pero it will tide you over during these hard times. A little bit bigger than before.[applause]This is intended to increase the salaries of national government workers, including teachers and nurses. Nurses, correct.[applause]  I am also asking Congress to pass the remaining packages of my Administration\u2019s Tax Reform Program, and the bills that would further raise excise taxes on --- very good, let us do it --- tobacco and alcohol. Sinong naninigarilyo dito? They should be exterminated from the face of the earth.[laughter]They are the ones... You know, I... I'm... I do not hide my --- what's wrong with me. I acquired Buerger's disease because I smoke. But I made it a national policy because you know when I was new mayor, I went around to see the discos and night clubs. I could hardly see the faces of the people inside. You have to wade into a thick smoke to just recognize one. So that's when I decided. But I was still smoking. But I decided because I knew, I already had it. So it's time to --- sabi ko. And a national law, para lahat na, that at 12 o' clock, everything closes. I am not trying to pull a chair here. Mine was that two o'clock noon sa Davao, it was two then I reduced it to one. When that boxing mayor there became mayor, she reduced it to six. Walang order, no orders in advance. Kasi we have ordered already, so you can close but we have to drink. Itong ngayon, at 12, everything closes down. Nobody works. So I... I think that we should adopt it. Most of the states, in many states, in many countries, ganun man. Alas dose, sarado na talaga. We have to stop drinking. And jukebox, they're only good up to eight, nine. Eight, maganda 'yan. It's a... It\u2019s there in every corner, store. Blares out noise and the children who will go to school and the working class, and you are there with your store. I have prohibited it in Davao. And at 12, as you see, Davao is quiet because everybody is resting already. Be it in the memorial parks, cemetery, or in the comfort of their homes. The valuation system has also to be improved local government units and rationalize capital income [taxation].I urge Congress to review and pass the Government Rightsizing Bill to reconfigure the existing Metro Manila-centric bureaucracy; streamline government systems in order to deliver services without delay and within a short timeline. These reforms would be for naught if we cannot avert of a \u201cnew poor\u201d every time a disaster strikes. The Philippine experience has shown that natural disasters and --- are poverty creators. That is why, we need to hasten the establishment of a Department of Disaster Resilience (DDR) so that these department focus on the natural hazards and climate change. I urge Congress to fast-track the passage of the Administration of this bill --- Administration version rather. In 2017, I reminded all of you of the probable consequence of a catastrophic earthquake in Metro Manila and its surrounding provinces. Since then, I have established the Project Management Office for the Earthquake Resilience and the Greater Manila Area to implement two-pronged strategy on earthquake resilience and mitigation efforts. I just heard, it's not in my speech. I just heard that from a psychic that the first crack when the \"Big One\" hits, will be right here in the center of this\u2026[laughter and applause] \u2018Yan man ang sabi nila. \"Philippines is so corrupt, it's so lousy that if you kill all congressmen, senators and the president, we will have a new day.\"[laughter]So I pray that if the earthquake comes, it comes now. This moment.[laughter]Kumpleto na tayo. May madamay pa tayo doon sa harap.[laughter] We weathered one damaging effect of climate change this year. The El Ni\u00f1o were wreaked havoc in the agricultural sector and caused water shortage in the greater Metro Manila area. We need to pass bill creating the Department of Water Resources and Water Regulatory Commission.[applause] Alam mo, the agencies and the guys there handling the --- the entire water works system --- you have to change it immediately. You know what, there was this three-day no water. I was in Davao. So everybody was complaining and I was even afraid to come here because what if my girlfriend will not be able to --- to take a bath.[laughter]She will smell like hell. So I said, I'll wait for the water to wash her. Alam mo kung hindi ako nagmura, kung hindi ko sinabi, \u201cp**** i**, papatayin ko kayo, p**** i** niyo.\u201d And then when I arrived in the morning, there was water. And my girlfriend was fresh.[laughter] I also call on Congress to pass a law mandating a Fire Protection Modernization Program. Diyan tayo nagka-ano. If you go to Davao, you'll find the best. The best of everything, 911, all the cameras, all the screens. We did that if you can find it. Alam mo --- alam mo sabi ni... Is there\u2026 Sonny is here? Secretary Dominguez? Ah Sonny. Siya man ang magyayabang. Sabi niya, \"marami tayong pera\". Pero \u2018pag tanungin namin siya doon sa Cabinet meeting, \u201ctsk tsk tsk tsk, walang pera, walang pera\u201d.[laughter]Si Diokno ganun rin kaya gi-tapon ko sa Central Bank.[laughter] Every time sabihin mo, you know we discussed projects, we plan and we submit it to Congress, it\u2019s final imprimatur. Eh \u2018di kami ang, \u201cMay pera ba tayo diyan, sir? \u201cWala.\u201d \u201cMagkano?\u201d \u201cFour billion.\u201d \u201cTsk tsk tsk tsk tsk that is not the tsk tsk practice. No money, no money.\u201d P***. Saan pala ang pera natin dito? Sa bulsa ninyo?[laughter]Karaming collection natin dito. But Sonny says that we can fund. This one we have to answer. Now, I would like to remind... Pagbigyan na lang ninyo ako tutal para naman ito sa lahat. Alas-sais pa nga ginugutom na kayo. Hindi pala kayo nag-merienda? Alam mo, ever since na-integrate 'yan you would notice in your cities and provinces the deterioration of the service itself. Wala ng mga truck, luma na. And would you believe it in Davao City, I'll show it to you, we have a 1934Studebaker fire truck. Maganda pa. So we have to --- we have to do better than this. There are other cities which are utterly --- - utterly without the tools to respond the challenges of fire. We have to come up with something that is really good. I mean at this age, it would be a shame if you cannot put up a fire in two days, three days, my God. We have to set aside. Sonny, you have the money?[laughter]Oh yes. Oh see. Basta sa maraming tao mahiya man mag-deny.[laughter]Totoo 'yan. Totoo 'yan. We have the money so maybe Sonny can give you a figure that we can set aside. Nakakahiya talaga itong ano natin. Ang Davao, meron. Davao has a very good 911. Hindi ako nagyayabang. And we have cameras in every corners that's why we can solve crimes immediately. And meron kaming 911. \u201cWhat is your emergency?\u201d That's the standard. So it's fire, they call the fire department. Sabi ko, \"911.\" \"Yes.\" \"What's your emergency?\" \"I --- I seemed to lost my --- to have lost my girlfriend.\u201d \"We know you, Mayor. You go back to Manila there are plenty left there. Go.\"[laughter] This will equip the fire --- Bureau of Fire Protection with tools to respond to the challenges. I further ask Congress to urgently pass the Na --- ito --- the National Land Use Act or NALUA within this year.[applause]Paki lang po. So that we can proceed with the new... Well, we can meet the --- the demands of the new investors coming in. Ang lupa natin ang problema eh. A science-based national land use plan would serve as basis for the LGUs in crafting respective development plans, and help disperse economic activities to the countryside. The dispersion of economic and business activities to Visayas and Mindanao is not just a campaign promise. It is an economic imperative and a key to our country\u2019s sustainable and equitable development. We will encourage investments that would develop the rural areas and Metro Manila and other mega urban areas. Let me cut here, tutal maliit na lang. I would just like to remind everybody. No offense intended to the mayors and governors to the local government. Pero 'yang style ninyo na it takes about three days, four days for the employees of a certain company, store, or whatever to go back and forth, back and forth. When they go back, you have a new regulation. He gets it, he secures it and when he goes back, oh there's still you have to follow --- you have to get this paper. I will tell you now. Hindi ako nagyayabang. In Davao, it's one hour unless there is a need for ocular inspection. I am directing you publicly mayors --- mayors. I am directing also the DILG, Secretary A\u00f1o of the local government to see to it that this is honored. All clearances, permits emanating from your office that would need also your approval, must be out at the very least within three days.[applause] You do not do that. I am directing si Secretary A\u00f1o, is he here, sir? Nandito ka? Oh Secretary A\u00f1o, he is the former chief of staff, he's also a military man. I want three days, unless there is an exceptional reason, three days, para hindi na magpa-balik-balik kasi diyan ang perahan eh. Pagdating doon meron na naman hingin, pagdating doon may hingin. Kaya I said the Filipinos if it is done to you, I'm telling you, slap the guy, create a scene, create a scandal because that incident however little will reach me. And if it does, you can be sure, if I do not call you and the idiot, I will go there myself. That is a promise, that is a pledge.[applause] Make it a part of my oath of office. Lahat kayo diyan pati \u2018yang tsk --- easement. Well, under Villar, okay na. Pero 'yang easement billion dollar --- ah billion pesos. Well, if it\u2019s a foreign company, it's a billion dollar thing. Ganun 'yan. Pabalik-balik at hindi binabayaran. That's why nagpatong... If all moneys and revenues due government are collected in good faith, marami tayong pera. I'm telling you as President. Marami tayong pera para extra money to uplift the --- the mass of Filipinos who are suffering. Maski ospital lang and housing. Jobs, it's the economy that runs it. If the economy is good, more jobs. At the meantime, itong hospitalization, education, the basic things at saka itong relocation. Kaawa talaga. Kung makolekta lang lahat hindi ma-corrupt ang pera, marami tayong pera. Kaya ako nagsabi. That's why I --- I resi... You know, I will make it public. I was at the Nayong Pilipino. I gave it to a group of people. Tapos nagpa-bidding sila. Ang nagbidding nila is to allow a gambling casino to be erected there inside the Nayong Pilipino. Kaya ko nagsabi t*** i** ninyo. Anong kahulugan ng Nayong Pilino kung lagyan mo ng sugalan and without a bidding? You know, nandiyan na 'yung mga generals, they are there, chief of staff. Kasi pag galing doon pumunta ako sa command conference. Pagdating ko sa command conference, may ipinasa si Sonny ghost delivery sa AFP hospital. Eh galing pa ako doon sa... When I was facing the military and police, sabi ko, \u201cLook, I thought I had my back covered by you? If I cannot trust you, you better tell me now. Because if you the commanders of the Air Force, Army pati Albayalde and the Navy, I will step down now. I am resigning, I'll go back to Davao. You do the explaining to the people why.\" Ginanun ko talaga. And in one of the Cabinet meetings ganun rin. There was this two-year, pabalik-balik na 'yung --- back and forth, back and forth, for two years it was sitting on their ass, the papers. So when they were explaining to me the revised plan and with so many requirements, clearances from NBI, I stood up with the Cabinet members, lahat kami.Ina Cabinet meeting Isaid, \u201cStop. That idiotic matrix is not for me. That is intended for the next--- maybe the president after the next.\u201d Lumabas ako sabi ko, \"Inyo na 'yang gobyerno ninyo.\" Sabi ko wala ako... I --- I'm tired. I'm tired and I am... Talagang gusto ko na rin mag-resign. Sabi ko I am not happy anymore. Sabi ko anytime --- ah the military said,ifyou want to go out? If you want to take overcoup d'etat, go ahead. Do not bring your armors. Do not bring your weapons here. Just call me and we'll have coffee. I do not believe.I think Marcos and Estrada were correct that they did not allow the... Kasi 'yung guwardiya mo,guwardiya dito, pareho 'yan. Lahat sila dadaan 'yan sa presidential command. All of them will be assigned. Nag-iikot'yan sila lahat. A taste of everything. Hanggang Mindanao kaya kilala ko 'yan sila lahat dumaan ng Mindanao eh. Sabi ko talaga, \"Inyo na. Ayaw ko na.\" Sabi ko, \"Sige, sinong gusto? Raise your right hands. I\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2026\u201d \u201cDuly appointed member of the junta, will now make the SONA next month.\u201d Ah bahala kayo diyan. You threatened about...If you think that you can run the country better than the elected one, go ahead. That\u2019s not my---it\u2019s the problem of the Filipino people. Talaga sa Cabinet na --- na tsk...Kaya abutan ako ng topak, magbaba dito ako ngayon. Bahala na kayo diyan. I'm going home. One ese --- one estimate pegs economic losses at P3.5 billion a day due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila. So meantime, I reiterate my directive, my request, my pleadings to the MMDA and all concerned local officials in Metro Manila, and all other cities, to undertake immediate action to ensure the speedy and smooth flow of vehicular traffic. Reclaim all public roads that are being used for private ends. Marami diyan.[applause] And again, I asked SecretaryA\u00f1o to see to it that this is enforced. If there is a mayor or a governor, or kung ano kang --- sino kang demonyo ka, i-suspend mo SirA\u00f1o. Give him time and if he cannot --- if he is not up to it, then pagpahingain mo na lang. Suspend mo na. Wala talagang --- wala tayong magawa. They just keep on pleasing their ownconstituents justbecause they are constituents --- a leader. Ganun kayo eh. The only way to do it... Anyway, me, I have no problem. Me, I am an inutil official. Me, I cannot run anymore. Me, after six years I might lose my head. Wala na ako. I... No more challenges inpolitics. No more mountains to climb. I will just do my duty. And most of my Cabinet members are actually military men.You know why? Gusto ninyong malaman? Do not be embarrassed. Atin-atin na lang ito. Huwag mo na silang pansinin, 'yang mga ano diyan. Parang nag meeting-meeting lang tayo dito.[laughter]'Yung parang nagpulung-pulong lang. Do not mind them.Eh kung tignan kasi ninyo mahiya kayo. Kasi ganito 'yan, mypenchant for military men. I want toingratiate myself to them? What? I was elected by the people, not by the military, not by the police. But to --- why do I have this I said --- this predisposed of\u2026Kasi utusan sila madali. Kasi 'pag sinabi mong walang corruption, walangcorruption. Kaya lang ang military and just like any organization, 'pag ang top diyangeneral o ang commander-in-chief corrupt, ku-corrupt 'yan lahat. Pero kung sabihin mo na matino ka, they will follow. So Boracay I sentCimatu. Sabi ko, \"Puntahan mo nga doon.\" IsGeneral Cimatu here, si Roy? Ah yeah. Itong si Roy nakilala ko ito sa Mindanao. Hindi ko man 'yan kilala. Mindanao... Na-mayor kasi ako 23 years. So all of them passed by Mindanao, kilala ko. 'Pag inutusan mo, kaagad. And they know that I will not give illegal orders for them to implement. Alam nila abugado ako. Sabi ko sundin lang ako ninyo. Kaya I was surprised when I ordered Cimatu to go there --- to Boracay, Sir Frank.Alam mo ang ginawa niya? The next day lumabas siyaroon sa Daily Mirror. Naglalakad siya doon sa beach, naka-t-shirt ng blue at 'yung mata niya nandoon sa dalawangCaucasian na nag...[laughter] \"G****** it, Cimatu. Akala ko ba inutusan kita?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"O bakit ka nagpalakad-lakad diyan sa beach tinitignan mo 'yung naka-bikini na dalawang puti?\" \"Sir, napadaan lang ako sir.\"Sabi ko,\"Trabahuin mo 'yan ha.\"And they did it in six months\u2019 time. Of course with a...[applause]I likeCimatu because he mixed his pleasure with work.[laughter]That is the way how to do it.[laughter] I give you until the last week of the year 'yung sa --- September na to do this. Clean the LGUs. Walang mangyari dito. We shall continue to invest in the countryside through agricultural programs that will increase the productivity and income of our small farmers and fisherfolk.We shall ensure the full implementation of the Rice Tariffication Law, including the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund. This will safeguard the livelihood of small farmers through the provisions of modern farm equipment and machineries, seeds and credit, and extension services. I also have not forgotten my commitment to uplift the lives --- ito --- coconut farmers and further develop the coconut industry until the urgent --- ah through the urgent utilization of the Coconut Levy Fund. That is 100 million.[applause]Kaya ako very careful until now wala akong nakuha. Look, it is really hard to look for an honest man. I must admit it. Baka ako hindi ko rin kaya. I do not have that well... Itong coco fund na ito, ito 'yung naiwan sa --- noong kay Marcos na levy fund. This is sacred money. This money was taken out of the pockets of the Filipinos arbitrarily. Wala kang magawa noon eh martial law. Ito na 'yan. Kaya itong coco levy fund, kung sabihin mo lang, tama ang Supreme Court. Hindi mo pwedeng maibigay --- sabi mo sino. You can no longer trace the truthful owner of the land. Ang plano ko, kung gusto ninyo, you save the money. You invest the money. Siguro mag-abot 'yan ng mga more than 100 billion. Ilagay na lang ninyo ng ano trust fund for the government. It\u2019s about mga 5 billion. Ayon na lang ang gastusin ninyo to reserve the money. Rather than do it parang sprinkle na ibigay mo sa mga tao. You cannot --- sabi ng Supreme Court tama sila --- you can no longer trace the genealogyof the owners --- the original owners. And sometimes it would fail. I will not act on that until I find the money. Wala pa akong nakuha.I have yet ---I have yet tolook for the money. Hanggang ngayon naghahanap ako. Wala akong makita. Kasi malaki ito and this will --- this will, you know, if you assign acorrupt idiot there. Kaya gusto --- ang gusto koo baka nagustuhan rin ninyo, i-deposito ko na lang. Let it remain as a remembrance to the people who lost their ah --- at that time. Tapos 'yung 5 billion, 'yon 'yung to improve the econo --- the improvement sa replanting sa coconut. Five billion, that\u2019s a big money. Pero kung ibigay mo,let it sprinkler,walang mangyayari. 'Yung taga-bigay kukuha 'yan --- 'yung pupunta. That's why itong Land Bank na ito, 'pag hindi ito na... You know, you are calledLand Bankbut you are now the number one commercial bank in the Philippines. What the heck is happening to you? You are supposed to finance agricultural enterprises and endeavors.Bakit wala?[applause]Bakit --- why can't you just buy a fewwagons or whatever? Go to the countryside and ask the people if there are cooperatives, tulungan ninyo to form one.[applause] 'Pag wala, eh tignan ninyo na maibigay ninyo for replanting of the coconut --- to revive the coconut industry. Pahiramin ninyo ng pera plus the money --- 'nung sabi ko of the coconut levy. That is sacred money.Land Bank should go back to land. Why are you mired in so many commercial transactions? Bumalik kayo where you were created for and that is to help the farmers. Ilang administration na wala?[applause]You better decide on that, I will give you until the end of July to give me a plan or else I will ask Congress to reconfigure you what-not. Wala eh, wala kayong...[applause] I'm asking now Congress, 'pag wala sila --- if there is no viable plan for that for the farmers and it is just all commercial transactions, might as well abolish it and give the money to the congressmen for their development funds.[laughter]O mas makatulong pa. Diretso eh. Ayaw ninyo?[laughter]O ayaw daw nila, Sir Frank. Huwag mo na lang galawin. I once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a more responsive version of the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers\u2019 Trust Fund to ensure the accelerated utilization of coco levy funds for the well-being and empowerment of the coconut farmers.[applause] We recognize the urgent need to ensure the sustainability and availability of resources and the development of alternative ones. In this regard, I trust that Secretary Cusi shall fast-track also the development of renewable energy sources, and reduce dependence on thetraditional energy sources such as coal.  Finally, sustaining our gains entails a national security posture capable of defending the country from external and internal security threats. Defense Secretary Lorenzana, together with the gallant men and women of the armed forces, is at the forefront of this fight. We expect support for legislative initiatives aimed at strengthening defense-related systems such as the proposed National Defense Act, the Unified Military and Uniformed Personnel Separation, Retirement, and Pension Bill, and the revival of the mandatory ROTC in Grades 11 and 12.[applause] Very important. Alam mo \u2018pag mag giyera-giyera, 10 out of 10 hindi marunong maghawak ng baril to defend even his father and mother and brothers and sisters. Itong mga bata ngayon, they are bereft of the patriotism and the love of country. Balik sila dito. I think a military training would be good for everybody. Kung hindi sige lang --- sa shabu, mamaya namatay, krrrkkk. \u201cDuterte: Extrajudicial killing. Report to the ICC.\u201d Ah okay. If you can provide me with a good comfortable cell, heated during winter time, I want to go --- and an air-conditioned during hot weather. And a conjugal visits, unlimited,[laughter]para we can understand each other. We are aware of the fact that there are times in AFP and PNP personnel,while in the performance of their duties, get unjustly sued. Providing them with free legal assistance to help and boost their morale. My fellow citizens, to borrow the words of Churchill --- akin \u2018to, this is mine: We are now entering a period of consequences. The consequences of what we did and did not do but should have done during my first half of my term. I assume full responsibility for that. As President, I cannot pass it --- the blame to anybody. So it\u2019s on me. Though we cannot change the past, we will not squander the future. I will push harder in the pursuit of programs that we have started, but always within the parameters of the law. I will not merely coast along or while away my time during the remaining years of my administration. It ain\u2019t my style.[applause]But I will not stop until I reach the finish line. Then and only then shall I call it a day.[applause] Our goal for the next three years is clear: a comfortable life for everybody, all Filipinos. We have made significant strides and accomplished signal milestones as a nation in the past three years. This momentum must continue with greater fervor in the next three years and beyond. I dream of glowing days ahead for every Filipino. I dream of a Philippines better than the one I grew up with. This is my pledge and commitment for just three years, if I can. If I cannot, I\u2019m sorry. But I shall continue to comply with my constitutional duty to serve and protect the Filipino, until the last day of my term. God Bless the Filipino. God Bless the Philippines. Thank you very much![applause] \u2013 Rappler.com For highlights of President Duterte\u2019s 4th SONA, check out our live blog.

Here is the full text of the 100-minute-long speech, as provided by the Malaca\u00f1ang. Duterte delivered it in English, punctuated by ad-libs in Filipino and a bit of Bisaya. *** Kindly sit down. Thank you. Allow me a little bit of informality at the outset. You would realize that the three guys in the elevated portion of Congress are from Mindanao. So, wala talaga kaming masabi. [applause] Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, members of the Senate, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the members of the House of Representatives, Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, President Fidel V. Ramos, President Joseph Estrada, President Arroyo, Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, and justices of Supreme Court, His Excellency Papal Nuncio and members of the diplomatic corps. We cannot... Well, of course, I have also to greet the Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, the members of the Cabinet, fellow workers in government, my countrymen. We cannot move forward if we allow the past to pull us back. Finger-pointing is not the way. That is why I will not waste precious time dwelling on the sins of the past or blaming those who are perceived to be responsible for the mess that we are in and suffering from. Except maybe extract a lesson or two from its errors we will not tarry because it is the present that we are concerned with and the future that we should be prepared for. Lest I be misunderstood, let me say clearly, that those who betrayed the people\u2019s trust shall not go unpunished and they will have their day in Court. [applause] And if the evidence warrants, they will have their day of reckoning too. When I decided to seek the presidency of this Republic, I knew what the ills of our country were; I knew their causes; and I was briefed on those who caused the causes. I heard the people on the streets complain that justice had become illusory; that equity and fairness and speedy disposition of cases had deteriorated into hollow concepts fit only for masteral dissertations. It was, and still is, very sad indeed. As a former prosecutor, I know there always --- ways of knowing how fast or how slow cases go. What I did was to look into the number of postponements and the time difference between each postponement and the next setting. It was simple as that. I will appreciate deeply if we all in government attend to this urgent need. I was determined then as I am now determined and better positioned, to wage war against those who make a mockery of our laws including those who make life for us all miserable. I wish to assure everyone though that vindictiveness is not in my system. [applause] Just like you and I, all, equal treatment and equal protection are what I ask for our people. [applause] But we must have the courage to fight for what we believe in, undeterred by the fear of failing or losing. Indeed, courage knows no limits, cowardice does. [applause] At this point, there are concerns few I wish to convey to all to the end that as I perorate on facts, figures, plans, programs, and solutions, these concerns will not dissipate or get lost along our way. Thus to our religious bishops, leaders, priests, pastors, preachers, imams let me assure you that while I am a stickler for the principle of separation between church and state, I believe quite strongly that there should never be a separation between God and State. [applause] During my inauguration last 30 [June] 2016, I said that the fight against criminality and illegal drugs and corruption will be relentless and sustained. I reiterate that commitment today. And that is why I call on the Philippine National Police, the barangay chairmen, the Mayors, and Governors and all those occupying seats of power and authority, not to lower their guard. There will be no let-up in this campaign. Double your efforts. Triple them, if need be. We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier, and the last pusher have surrendered or put behind bars [applause] or below the ground, if they so wish. [applause] To our police officers and other officials, do your job and you will have the unwavering support of the Office of the President. [applause] I will be with you all the way. Abuse your authority, and there will be a hell to pay, [applause] for you will have become worse than criminality itself. I order the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) to hasten the conduct of investigation and adjudication of administrative cases against police officers involved in criminal activities and illegal activities and prescribe policies on lifestyle checks for PNP members. In this quest, I will put at stake my honor, my life, and the presidency itself. [applause] The DILG is also directed to strictly monitor how LGUs perform their supervision functions of the police and those found not performing will be sanctioned including the loss of police deputation from the NAPOLCOM. Let me repeat my warning to all: Do not do drugs [applause] because you will be the solution to the drug crisis that has engulfed \u2013 malawak \u2013 the nation. We will create an Inter-Agency Committee on Illegal Drugs that will integrate efforts and strengthen the partnership of all stakeholders. The reservists will be mobilized for information campaign against drug use and the dissemination of information regarding drug rehabilitation programs being offered by the government. Let us also strengthen our ROTC Program to instill love of country and good citizenship. [applause] We will also prioritize the rehabilitation of drug users. We will increase the number of residential treatment and rehabilitation facilities in all regions of the country. [applause] The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will facilitate the preparation for the use of military camps and facilities for drug rehabilitation. [applause] There can never be real, tangible and felt development without making our people feel secure and it is our duty to uplift the people\u2019s welfare. With this, my administration shall be sensitive to the State\u2019s obligations to promote, and protect, fulfill the human rights of our citizens, especially the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable and social justice will be pursued, even as the rule of law shall at all times prevail. My administration shall implement a human approach to development and governance, as we improve our people\u2019s welfare in the areas of health, education, adequate food and housing, environmental preservation, and respect for culture. Human rights must work to uplift human dignity. [applause] But human rights cannot be used as a shield or an excuse to destroy the country --- your country and my country. [applause] Meantime, since our country continues to be confronted with internal security threats aggravated by the existence and activities of the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf, the full force of the AFP will be applied to crush these criminals who operate under the guise of religious fervor. The AFP shall enhance its capability to search and engage these rogue and lawless elements. We have to strengthen our coordination with Indonesia and Malaysia to suppress the kidnappings in the waters of our neighboring countries. We will strengthen our counter-terrorism programs by amending various laws on human terrorism, terrorism financing and cybercrime. This is our answer to the challenges of the global development\u2019s non-traditional threats, transnational crimes and fanatical terrorism. Addressing global warming shall all will be our top priority, but upon a fair and equitable equation. [applause] It must not stymie our industrialization. We also endeavor to develop and corporate partnerships with nations sharing common interests and concerns with the Philippines; maintain and sustain bilateral and multilateral consultations and dialogues. We will continue to expand cooperation on human assistance, disaster response, maritime security and counter terrorism. We shall deepen security dialogues with other nations to build greater understanding and cooperation. With regard to the West Philippine Sea otherwise known as [South] China Sea, we strongly affirm and respect the outcome of the case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration as an important contribution to the ongoing efforts to pursue the peaceful resolution and management of our disputes. [applause] On the aspect of our peace processes relating to our engagement with the international community, the Philippines shall remain committed to work under and with international partners achieving lasting peace and progress in the country. We will vigorously address the grievances that have been time and again expressed, not only by the Bangsamoro, indigenous peoples and other groups for security, development, fair access to decision-making and acceptance of identities. Enduring peace can only be attained only if we meet these fundamental needs of every man, woman and child. [applause] To our Muslim brothers, the Moro country, and the members of the CPP/NPA/NDF, let me say this: All of us want peace, not the peace of the dead, but the peace of the living. [applause] We express our willingness and readiness to go to the negotiating table, and yet we load our guns, fix our sights, pull the trigger. It is both ironic and tragic \u2013 and it is endless. While we extol the bravery and heroism of our soldiers \u2014 kayo the rebels \u2013 do the same for the members and fighters. What I see instead are the widows and the orphans. And I feel their pain and grief. And no amount of cash assistance or the number of medals can compensate the loss of a human life. [applause] Sorrow cuts across every stratum of society. It cuts deeply and the pain lasts forever. That is why, I reach out to you, to all of you today. To our Muslim brothers, let us end the centuries of mistrust and warfare. To the CPP/NPA/NDF, let us end these decades of ambuscades and skirmishes. We are going nowhere. And it is getting bloodier by the day. To immediately stop violence on the ground, restore peace in the communities and provide enabling environment conducive to the resumption of the peace talks, I am now announcing a unilateral ceasefire with the CPP/NPA/NDF effective immediately. [applause] And call on our Filipinos in the National Democratic Front and its forces to respond accordingly. Let me make this appeal to you: \u201cIf we cannot, as yet, love one another, then in God\u2019s name, let us not hate each other too much,\u201d so it was said. [applause] I say the same to you today. We will strive to have a permanent and lasting peace before my term ends. That is my goal, that is my dream. [applause] On the macroeconomic management, my administration will continue and maintain current macroeconomic policies, and even dobetter.We will achieve this through prudent fiscal and monetary policies that can help translate high growth into more and better job creation and poverty reduction. By the end of my term, I hope \u2013 I hope and pray \u2013 to hand over an economy that is much stronger, characterized by solid growth, low and stable inflation, dollar reserves, and robust fiscal position. On taxation, my administration will pursue tax reforms towards a simpler, and more equitable, and more efficient tax system that can foster investment and job creation. We will lower personal and corporate income tax rates [applause] and relax the bank secrecy laws. [applause] Eh na-Presidente ako eh. Ayaw ko sana makialam dito sa mga \u2018to. Alam mo na. Well, anyway. May I continue. At the household level, there must be sufficient income for all Filipinos to meet the basic food and non-food needs for their families. We shall continue attract investments that will generate thousands of jobs each year \u2013 jobs that are suitable for the poor and less skilled members of the workforce. Reforms to ensure competitiveness and promote ease of doing business will be mandatory. [applause] Reacting to these needs, the restrictions on the economy will be needed to make more investments to come and to develop labor-intensive industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and tourism shall be pursued. We must also invest in human capital and ensure equal access to economic opportunities. The implementation of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Lawmust be put into full force and effect [applause] so that couples, especially the poor, will have freedom of informed choice on the number and spacing of children they can adequately care and provide for, [applause]eventually making them more productive members of the labor force. When employment is not an option, for instance in extremely rural neighborhoods, entrepreneurship will be advocated.  We shall also enhance local business environment by addressing bottlenecks in business registration and processing, streamlining investment application process and integration the services of various government offices. Government Financing Institutions (GFIs) shall come up with out-of-the box financing packages to capacitate our small and medium entrepreneurs. In the field of tourism, we shall construct more access roads and tourism gateways to service centers and tourist sites. Road development projects shall complement with our thrust to provide modern agriculture, infrastructural by expanding and improving the construction and rehabilitation of roads and the irrigation and establishing modern harvest and post-harvest facilities to minimize losses. We shall also conduct a nationwide soil analysis to determine areas most suitable for rice farming to optimize production with the use of effective soil rehabilitation and fertilization. We shall strictly enforce fisheries laws, particularly on illegal fishing and promote aquaculture along river banks and in backyards. On the other hand, we will accelerate infrastructure spending by improving national roads and bridges and implementing the Mindanao Logistics Infrastructure Network [applause] and other road network master plans. We shall pursue inter-island linkage projects. We shall be implementing structural mitigation measures to address of the perennial flooding in Metro Manila and neighboring areas. [applause] We shall put up newpumping stations in strategic places. The revival of the operation of the Pasig River Ferry Service System is a viable option for the severe traffic congestion in Metro Manila. This serves as an alternative mode of transportation for passengers particularly those coming from the east side of Metro to reach specific destinations within the cities of Manila, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Taguig, Marikina and Quezon City. Our anti-colorum campaign and out-of-line apprehension including the removal of terminals will be intensified and, my God, it will be done. [applause] Immediately, immediately. To address lack of road infrastructure in Metro Manila, usage of existing roads will be maximized. Thus, there is a need to cooperate and coordinate with LGUs to map out secondary routes and to consult various stakeholders, including the public transport operators. Many in government opine realistically, and I would have to agree, that the worsening traffic situation could be logically addressed, if Congress would also accord emergency powers to the agencies concerned. [applause] Ayaw mo? Okay lang rin. Para makita namin kung gusto ninyong madalian. Alam naman talaga ninyo sagad na lahat, sagad na. Nasa inyo \u2018yan. If you give it, fine. If you don\u2019t, we take the longer route, slowly. And tanggapin ko \u2018yung pag-mumura ninyo. \u2018Wag lang sa malapit. [laughter] Eh ganun talaga eh. You\u2019ve done it. It's an urgent and immediate situation, solution. Gusto ninyo madali lang, okay. Kapag ayaw naman ninyo, because baka sabihin niyo graft and corruption eh \u2018di okay. But I assure you \u2014 wala ito sa script \u2014 I assure you, this will be a clean government. [applause] If that is the only worry that you have and I can understand your misgiving. Wala na ito sa... ang haba. [laughter] Wala na ito sa script. You know, ako maka-garantiya, 101 percent it will be clean. The problem is I can only act through agencies and departments. That\u2019s why I urge you na maski konting mali lang, wala akong ano sa inyo, wala na akong politika, wala na. I\u2019m through after this. I just pass on to you the information that, you know\u2026 I act through secretaries and... I cannot guarantee their honesty and competence at all times. Cabinet members, yes. Pero yung sa baba \u2014 yung procurement, yung magbi-bidding diyan. But as far as I can really --- malinis talaga \u2018to. At napag-usapan namin sa likod about the federal system. You know my advice to you is maintain a federal system, a parliament, but be sure to have a president. Huwag\u2026 Hindi na ako niyan. [applause] I\u2019m disqualified and by that time I would longer be here. But, I can commit today to the Republic of the Philippines and its people: If you hurry up the federal system of government and you can submit it to the Filipino people by the fourth, fifth year, proseso \u2018yan e. You call for a referendum and after that call for a presidential election, I will go. Sibat na ako. But you just have a president. You copy the France system. Huwag mo hayaan yung puro na parliament. Delikado iyon. It takes time even for the\u2026 Iyong kagaya ng England noon. There was this bomb, double deck. It took them time really. There\u2019s no one apparatus for a commander-in-chief down. You can have a president you can elect. Maybe Tito Sotto would be the lucky guy at that time. O, \u2018di, limitahan mo lang. Ceremonial powers. Power to dissolve, power to accept the resolution or whatever, mandating you this, do that, or ceremonial powers except yung in times of need, if there\u2019s a demand for action. You must have a president. Wala na ako niyan. I said if you can give me that document, I will urge you to conduct a --- to order --- to order, call for an election the following day, following week. And even if there is still two years, three years I will go. Okay na ako. Do not worry about me. I don't aim to that much ambition. Eh nanalo ka eh. Hindi ko nga alam bakit nandito ako ngayon. Noon nandoon lang ako o. [applause] Totoo man. Sino man nagsuporta sa inyo sa akin dito? Wala man? [laughter] Not a single congressman. Except for two provinces, governor. \u2018Yun lang. Wala akong barangay captain. Wala akong\u2026 wala lahat. Pero ngayon. [laughter] Processing time in issuing permits and licenses shall be reduced to the barest minimum, in my city, it is always three days for local governments. That will bind the Office of the President down to the last barangay elect. Three days. Three days. [applause] Local government. Business permit, clearances, no follow-ups. Bigyan mo ng stub. Be back next week, tingnan mo yung work load and I will require every department, yung dito sa itaas. They must have a log book. Huwag sa computer. Kasi itong ganito na, nae-erase yan. Lagyan mo date, time, \u2018I accept the documents of Rodrigo Duterte.\u2019 Then you go to your computer. You must have an actuarial projections there. Look at the work load. Napaka-bobo mo naman. Tingnan mo, \u2018Ilan ang workload ninyo?\u2019 Pagkatapos, 'O bumalik ka dito, August 3, 3 o'clock.' Iyan 3 o'clock, ibigay mo, ibigay mo. Ngayon, I will be establishing 8888, only for, dedicated to corruption. [applause] Kapag may marinig ako sa Executive Department, even a whisper, even a whisper, hiwalay-hiwalay na tayo. Marami diyan, diyan sa gallery marami diyan walang trabaho, nag-aaply hanggang ngayon. [laughter] Hindi naman lahat kasi mayayaman yan eh. Mga asawa ninyo ata \u2018yan. While the issuance and distribution of motor vehicle plates at point of sale, or through motor vehicle dealers shall be considered. Huwag na sa LTO kasi hanggang ngayon, panahon pa ni Hesukristo yung first plate nila, hanggang ngayon wala pa. [laughter] Bayad na yon. Until now, sa awa ng Diyos. For the driver\u2019s licenses, its effectiveness will be extended from the current 3-year period to 5 years. [applause] To reduce queuing time at ticketing stations, tickets sa mga train will be made readily available and easily accessible to the riding public kung bilhin mo \u2018yan sa malls, stalls and stores. Eh ipinagbibili mo yung mga sa --- e 'di diyan mo na ibigay at credited. Huwag doon banda sa Recto kasi sigurado pekein \u2018yan. [laughter] May I address again to the Filipino: Ako po\u2019y nagdo-doble ang pagod para sa inyo, para sa kapakanan ng bayan. Seryoso po ako. Kaya yung mga ganun, ticket-ticket at magkaroon ng gulo, huwag ho ninyong gawain yan. Ito na yung warning ko, yon na ang last, wala nang iba, hindi ko na gagawin: Huwag ninyong sirain yung mga bagay-bagay na ginagawa namin para sa kapakanan ng tao. Mabuti ang magka-intindihan tayo [applause]. Mamaya yung kayo --- kaibigan ko --- tangad, tangad, tangad [laughter] Kaya huwag na ninyong gawin. Simple lang \u2018yan eh. Para walang away sa gobyerno, yung mga bagay na illegal at masama at hindi tama, huwag mong gawin, at hindi kami mag-aaway dito [applause]. Pati yung pari ha --- pati si Pope tinamaan. Let us be clear with each other. I am for the comfort and the welfare of the Filipino. Kayo namang hindi pa bungog diyan, hindi pa pumasok yang mga droga, eh kung ayaw ninyong mamatay, ayaw ninyong masaktan, huwag kayong umasa diyan sa mga pari pati Human Rights, hindi nakakapigil yan ng kamatayan. So huwag ninyong gawin. Eh tapos nandiyan ka nakabulagta and you are portrayed in a broadsheet na parang Mother Mary cradling the dead cadaver of Jesus Christ. Eh yan yang mga yan magda-dramahan tayo dito. [Dito ako nakatingin kasi nandito ang public eh]. Alam mo, ilang beses ko na sinasabi, sa Davao, \u2018Huwag mong gawin kasi magkaka-problema tayo.' He who is the cause of the cause is the cause of them all. [applause]. Ikaw yung nag umpisa, you swallow --- Ulitin ko ha: He who is the cause of the cause is the cause of them all. Kami nagta-trabaho lang. We have a mission to God. We have millions of people to see that they are healthy. It\u2019s a question of drug, it\u2019s a question of public interest, public order. Kita mo, lesser crime. Wala na kasing magnanakaw, wala nang naghoholdap. Kasi para ---Bakit tapos sabi nila eh, 'maliliit lang \u2018 yan'. Gamitin mo utak mo. If you are able to contaminate, kagaya ng negosyo ng mga Chinese, wholesale yan sila. Maski konti-konti kung the whole of Tondo contaminated, pera \u2018yan. I am not saying it's the Chinese. Practice of nitong wholesale, retail. They go for wholesale. Maski na kumita lang ng isang piso diyan sa isang... Okay na yan. Kasi paramihan eh. Iyan ang ibig kong sabihin. Now, let... I hope the military and the police will not react on this. It is part of the deep intelligence that we have gathered. I am forced to come in public, kasi pati yung mga pari nag-aano\u2026 Alam mo kayong mga media, naghahanap kayo ng, \"Where\u2019s the big fish?\" \"Saan yung bilyonaryo na mayaman, yung may kotse, yung may mga Mercedez na yan?\u201d Ma\u2019am, nandoon yan sila sa labas, wala dito. Maghanap ka ng isang batalyon na pulis para hulihin natin doon. Kung kaya natin. They direct the traffic of drugs sa kanila. Meron silang ganito, malaki. Real time. Nakikinig sila ngayon dito. I am very --- 101 percent, nakikinig yan. Nandoon. Doon lang. Izo-zoom in nila sa Tondo. \u2018O, itapon mo diyan. Tapos umalis ka, kunin mo doon sa tindahan yung bag o package.\u2019 Nasaan yung mga nakikita ng media na... Kayo lang ang naba-brand niyan na \"drug lord\" eh. Those are not the drug lords. Mga lieutenant, delivery boy yan. Kumbaga LBC lang yan pati DHL pwede rin. Pati yung tawag nilang \"basura\", yun yung street ano. Huwag kayong maghahanap. Gusto niyo, sabihin niyo, puntahan natin, I\u2019ll give you the names. I\u2019ll show you the intelligence paper pero give me the guarantee na may magawain ka. Because I\u2019ll give you the name, I\u2019ll give you the country. Kung wala ka ring magagawa, mag-shut up ka. [laughter]. Kaya hindi lang kami nag... But do not get too personal about our work here. I am saying that dito... [Balik na tayo kasi yung hindi nakakaintindi ng Tagalog ano na yung, ang tagal naman nito...] Passenger capacity congestion shall be addressed by increasing the number of running trains from the current 16 trains [applause] with a total of 48 cars per hour, to 20 trains with a total of 60 cars per hour. You increase the train speed from 40 [kph] to 60 [kph]. Ang problema nito, yung mga railway na ito [Hindi na ito kasali diyan. Huwag kayong maniwala dito] Two-thirds of these are mine, the other third is yung --- correct yung grammar ko, ayaw lang nila. Sixty kilometers per hour. Problema nito, and you must agree with me, that the rails are quite aged. Most of the rails maybe, doon pa yan sa panahon ni Marcos, Imelda. Nandyan pa. Ngayon, sabi ni Tugade, pagbigay sa akin sabi ko '40 to 60 kilometers per hour.' Sabi ko, \u2018Art, sigurado ka maka-hold ang rail niyan? Baka maputol \u2018yan mag diretso ang train sa Cavite.' [laughter] Diretso ng Cavite, mulipad doon kay Tolentino. [laughter] 'O bakit may train dito sa Tagaytay?' It\u2019s quite fast, quite fast. Sixty kilometers per hour and you are pulling something that\u2019s heavy.When it really moves --- mawala ng ano--- it moves with a speed at a heavy thing at a great speed, ang hirap mong... Sumasadsad kasi mabigat eh and reduce headway time from 5 minutes to 3 minutes. Mahina lang tayo...Ang plano ni Tugade, mahina lang tayo ng one minute sa Hong Kong. Two minutes, sa kanila three minutes eh. Art, ambisyoso ka ah. Kaya mo kaya ito? Specifically for the LRT, the operating hours shall be extended from 9:30 to 10:30 p.m., so marami pang mga bata ang uuwi niyan. [applause] And to absorb more passengers, delays in the procurement of additional trains shall be addressed soonest. Now, iyan ang sinasabi ko, if you want the long way, fine. Wala akong problema. Sabihin ninyo na doon ang --- we go the normal way if we are able to make purchases. Eh ang maganda nito, I have signed the Executive Order sa aming FOI. Naunahan ko kayo. Iyong inyo... Nandoon na ang sa akin [applause]. Oo, tapos na ako. Ilabas ko na --- it will be out today. Alam mo sabi ko, unahan na natin itong Congress, puro mayayabang ang mga nandiyan. We grab the --- each other...They say, \"stealing one\u2019s thunder,\" ika nga. Unahan na natin. So, we shall also pursue rail projects in Metro Manila and the major key-points in the country including the Mindanao Rail Project [applause]. Hindi ako nagyayabang pero totoo talaga \u2018to. Well, depende sa federal. But six years, lalabas talaga ito. I assure you because it\u2019s going to materialize: Rail projects, the Davao Transit System, the Cebu Transit System, the North and South Luzon Railways and the Panay Railways project. Kita mo? Panay. Eh taga saan si ano? Eh 'di Panay. Panay ang bigay natin para\u2026 [laughter and applause] Sabihin naman ni Senator Drilon, 'Binack-bite ka dito. Lalagyan daw nung ano, yung island mo ng train. May tawa pa.' Binaback-bite ka dito. Mag-sumbong man 'yan. Tingnan mo 'yan. Different approaches are also being considered to decongest NAIA including the possible transfer of general aviation. Ito ang...I will... Hindi... Ang style ko kasi ganito...Hindi naman ako... I am not sticking to formalities. Itong trans \u2014 general aviation, alam mo kung sino ang tinatamaan niyan? Kayong mayayaman. Kayong may mga helicopter pati eroplano, ilipat ko kayo. [applause] Alam mo yung general aviation niyo --- mga Learjets, mga 'yung mga sa mga ano kumpanya, ilagay ko kayo sa Batanes para wala masyadong air traffic [applause]. No, I\u2019m offering Sangley Point. [applause] Kasi kahihiyan ko ang isang runway. I can make a new runway there, sabi ng mga aviation experts but tumbok niyan is the Merville Subdivision. Baka isa pa akong runway dito sa Metro Manila. But if not them, it\u2019s going to be Clark but on a condition that we will have a fast train.Sabi ko kay Art, it will be something like 30. One hour of travel, sabi ko kay Tugade, is not acceptable. Make a rail there bago, marami nang... [inaudible] is the bullet train. Ilagay mo yan sa Filipino na driver, sutoy talaga kayo doon, maglampas kayo. [laughter] The Clark Airport can be utilized to shift some operations of our domestic and international airlines. Moreover, a one-stop shop will be established within the civil aviation complex for the benefit of the Overseas Filipinos. [applause] Ito mangyari na \u2019to: To utilize the Clark Airport, it is necessary to establish... Yung mga, well, you have a rail to connect. [Tapos na yan. Itaas mo na kay na i-Tagalog ko na.] In the area of environment, the military is directed to intensify its support [Makinig kayo, sigig tawa diyan] its support role against illegal logging, illegal mining, nandyan pa naman si Gina Lopez, and other destructive practices that aggravate the devastation of our natural resources. [applause] I have to protect the country. Many are complaining against the appointment of Gina Lopez. But si Gina pati ako, we share the same paradigm: The interest of the country must come first. But hindi ko naman sinasabi, there\u2019s a law allowing mining. Gina Lopez and I are just telling you: Follow government standards. Do not destroy the environment. Follow it to a tee. [applause] Wala tayong problema. Just pay the correct taxes, follow the standards. Gina is just doing her job. You know, she\u2019s a really a crusader, that is how I describe her persona: Crusader. Sabi ko tama yan. Bakit? Nandiyan ba si Ma\u2019am? Si Gina Lopez? Secretary Lopez, nandiyan? [DENR Secretary Lopez stands up and waves] Ganito yan, pumunta siya sa Davao. Gabi na mga 1 o\u2019clock because on the early days of my --- when I won, pero hindi pa ako nag-oath, marami nang nagpuntahan. Felicitations, congratulations. Eh si ma\u2019am pumunta twice. Every time, she shows me the degradation of [inaudible] Tapos dalawang oras naman mukhang hindi na matapos. Sabi ko, 'Ma\u2019am' [laughter]. Ma'am, do not be offended ha, totoo man. Huwag ka magalit kay --- it\u2019s the truth. So maga-alas tres na, tapos extemporaneous siya, para ring congressman. Sabi ko, \"Ma\u2019am, maga-alas quarto na.\" \"Ma\u2019am, ano kaya kung ikaw na lang ang DENR?\" [applause and laughter] Bigla din siya nagsagot, \u201cTotoo ka?\u201d [laughter] \"Oo.\" Hindi yung \"oo,\" [laughter]. Sabi niya, \"I will ask the --- I will consult my family and ask my...\" The following day, tawag siya kay --- my aide, kay Bong. Sabi niya, \u201cBong, okay na, tinanggap na. Sabi ng pamilya ko, okay na.\u201d Sabi ko, \u201cHay, bantay kayo lahat.\u201d [laughter] But you know, I would not be appointing somebody who is alien to my thinking. I would take in somebody who shares my horizons in life, especially yung degradation ng --- Tama yan. She is a crusader and she will continue. Dito naman eh...The DENR is likewise directed to review all permits granted to the mining, logging and other environmental sensitive activities to ensure compliance with government standards and if warranted, ito na yung pinakamaganda: amend, suspend or revoke permits. Go ahead. [applause] I\u2019d like to thank God that I had this opportunity really --- I never--- wala namang ano, I never thought umabot ako dito. I\u2019ve always... That...Sa isip ko mahirap itong ano. Itong Laguna Lake, naubos ang mga... Wala na ang fishermen. Iyon na lang --- the difference with one big fish pen to the other --- iyon nalang ang sa mga tao. Makita mo sa plane every time I go to Davao, I pass by that lake there. Every time nakita ko, talagang wala ng ano. And the fishermen are complaining about their loss. Talagang wala na sila kasi ang maliit na lugar iyon lang ang kanila. So dito pinaraan ko lang in diplomatic way that the Laguna Lake shall be transformed into a vibrant economic zone showcasing ecotourism by addressing the negative impact of the watershed destruction, land conversion and pollution. Ito ang nilagay ko. This is what I am telling you. The poor fishermen will have priority in its entitlements. [applause] Order to Gina is: Ayusin mo, Ma\u2019am. Huwag mo namang ipitin but they have to reduce the areas of occupation. They cannot have their cake and eat it too. Sila na yung may pera, sila na yung --- this must stop. So kung itanong, 'Sino ang may-ari niyan?' Simple lang: general, mga mayor, governor, baka congressman --- this is not personal. This is something that I feel that I must do because it is the right thing to do. [applause] To have adequate disposal facilities for the Metro Manila Garbage, the final closure and rehabilitation of the Carmona Sanitary Landfill shall be pursued while the adoption of appropriate waste-to-energy facilities will be explored. Marami yan. The technology is coming very fast. In the area of governance, there is a need to strengthen our efforts along this line. [Itaas mo na. Itaas yang paragraph na yan] Ito... Select the best answer... [Ang taas na. Huh? Mabubuang ka] To better manage public information, a law should be passed \u2013 I\u2019m addressing Congress-- to create the People\u2019s Broadcasting Corporation, replacing PTV-4, [applause] the government-run TV station,which now aims to replicate international government broadcasting networks. Teams from these international news agencies --- I\u2019d like to mention those interested BBC --- are set to visit the country soon to train people from government-run channels to observe. Ito ang gusto ko --- tutal pera naman ng tao --- to observe editorial independence through innovative programs [applause] and intelligent treatment and analysis of news reports, as well as developments of national and international significance. The government\u2019s Bureau of Broadcast Services, better known as the Radyo ng Bayan, shall undergo upgrading to make it financially viable and dependable for accurate and independent, and enlightening news and commentary. Radyo ng Bayan will be integrated with the PBC. As we are presently setting up a Presidential Communications Satellite Office in Davao City, PBC will also put up broadcast hubs in the Visayas and Mindanao. [applause] Davao City will also be the first site of the first Muslim channel, to be called Salaam Television, [applause] and the first Lumad channel. [applause] The PCO shall coordinate with the Office of the Executive Secretary and the Presidential Legal Counsel in implementing the recently approved EO on the Freedom of Information. There is an Executive Order, it's out. As an example on the part of the Executive Branch to make transparency and integrity as yardsticks in government performance, savings and expenses while engaging the public to be vigilant in participating in government programs and projects. The PCO, in coordination with the Office of the Executive Secretary, is drafting the Administrative Order on the Task Force on media killings. This government does not condone violence and repression of media. [applause]The bona fide media... Bona fide media...Sometimes they pronounce it \"bonafid\". But whatever that thing is, the bona fide media has always been our partner for change. [applause] Medyo klaro yan. Anong gawin mo sa hindi bona fide media? Iyan ang problema. To address backlogs and low prosecutorial effectiveness and efficiency, the investigation and case management processes shall be streamlined including those for illegal drugs and heinous crimes. To eradicate the prevalent cultures of fear and silence that have hounded our justice system, I asked Congress \u2014 you \u2014 to enact the Whistleblower Protection Law while the present Witness Protection Program shall be strengthened. [applause][Hirap maging Presidente. Maski dito lang.] [laughter] The number of lawyers and support staff in the PAO \u2014 that is the Public Assistance Office \u2014 regional and districts shall be increased to provide indigents with more access to counsels. [applause] At this stage, I also have directed the DILG to undertake nationwide information and campaign on federalism in partnerships with various alliances and with LGU, civil society, grassroots and faith-based organizations. [applause] Punta muna ako dito ha, itong federalism. Ewan ko kung tama. Alam mo, itong bayan natin, if I may just repeat. I know that you know \u2014 on 1521, Magellan landed in Leyte. [laughter] Kumare ko man ito. [Salamat, mare ha.] [laughter] Mindanao was already Islam by 100 years. So, ano ito, it\u2019s an imperialism thing. There\u2019s a historical injustice committed against the Moro people. We have to correct it. But it is well possible now. Kaya kayong mga kapatid kong mga Moro, alam naman ninyo. Ako, I\u2019m mixed. Migrant ang tatay ko doon. So, mixed-blood ako. Moro pati Christian. But, you know, intindihin na lang natin ito, that we can return to you all. Iyong nakuha ng mga Amerikano, Espa\u00f1ol, pati yung mga Pilipino, mga kapitalista, those who exploited Mindanao with that thing sloganeering go to Mindanao because it is a land of promise. With the vast entry of so many people, basically coming from the Visayas, magkaroon tayo ng\u2026 We cannot solve it the way you want it to be. We have to understand each other then you have to live with each other, but we will try. Ang sinasabi kong babalik ako, dahil ako sa federalism. Both Misuari, Sema and all, at least the politiko leaders ng Mindanao will agree to it. We do not...Remember that ako \u2018yung\u2026 Hindi ko dinidikdik yung masyadong Abu Sayyaf because it is really connected with the first talks between Misuari, the President, subsequently President Marcos and now, until now, until now. The only way they said that we can have this. Iyong BBL, ibigay na natin, minus the things that you do not want. [applause] Iyong mga Constitutional issues. Tanggalin muna natin. Ibigay ko yung area. Nandiyan na yan eh. So I ask you pass it minus the Constitutional issues that are contentious. [applause] Ibigay na natin at when the federal system comes, isali mo na sa package, together with Misuari. That is the solution for Mindanao. Nothing else. Believe me. Nothing else will do. Please sleep on it, ponder on it, because that\u2019s the only way to proceed. On the clamor of our citizens for timely issuance of Philippine passports, the government shall work towards amendment of the 1996 Passport Law to lengthen the validity of the passports from the current 5 years to 10 years. [applause] Tutal kayo naman ang maggagawa ng batas. You are the ones who will pass the law, even if you make it good for 30 years, okay ako. Bahala kayo. [laughter] Basta, stretch a little bit because five years is just really simply on a regular basis. Matagal pa naman itong passport. Mag-apply ako, ten days. Alam mo, I\u2019d like to call the attention of Secretary Yasay. If you go to Davao, look back doon sa\u2026 Look at the back, likod ng nitong mall, yung malaking mall doon. O sige, pangalanan na natin, SM. Doon, yung mga tao nandiyan sa pavement natutulog. For the many times nadaan ako na walang ulan, doon lang sila because first come, first served. And the only outlet there --- the outlet of your department is yung sa SM. So yung mga, maawa ako. Dito sa side sa Cotabato, lahat ng Cotabato, doon sa Davao. Karamihan yan, walang mga bahay. If you\u2019re an applicant in Davao City, fine. But you know, kung walang, mahirap kasi. Karamihan diyan, mga Moro. Naghihiga lang diyan sa pavement. Nasasaktan talaga ako. Masakit eh. Buong gabi mo hintayin hanggang mag-bukas yang SM kasi first come, first served. Kaya sabi ko\u2026 But that is...I am addressing to all of the Cabinet members: Make use of the computer. I do not want to see people lining up under the heat of the sun. I do not want people lining up under the rain. [applause] And I want itong labor... Wala na ito sa script. [Iyong prompter natutulog na siguro \u2018to, papindot-pindot diyan.] [laughter] Alam mo, nandiyan naman yan. Sabi ko what I want is a journal. When the applicant presents the documents, give them a shopping list. Do not add or get anything away from it. Iyon lang yon, final. And when he complies with that, that is good. Huwag mo na siyang pabalikin. [applause] Kasi kung mag-tawag yan ng 8888, my God, puntahan ko talaga kayo. Iyan ang bisyo ko noong mayor ako. It will not make a difference mayor o presidente. Puntahan talaga kita, hiyain kita sa maraming tao. And I would publicly ask you: \u201cWhat the hell happened to the procedure?\u201d Pupuntahan ko talaga kayo. Local, barangay, pulis, military, lahat. Bigyan mo ng shopping list, huwag mo ng pabalikin. Because pag mag-tawag ng 8888 yan, tapos makita ko na the grievance is valid, bahala ka. Anong walang panahon? Pupuntahan kita sa opisina mo. [inaudible] Bakit? Bigyan mo ng stub. You have to employ actuarial ability, that\u2019s easy. Para pag-tanggap ng tao \u2014 I\u2019m addressing myself, under me \u2014 journal. Papirmahin mo siya. Lagyan mo doon, tingnan mo sa computer. Mag-connect ka doon sa actuarial. Hindi mo kailangan ng bobo diyan e. Matatapos siguro yan mga next month tapusin ko. Projections lang naman. 'O, balik ka dito August 15, 3 o\u2019clock.' Pagdating, ibigyan yan. Now, if he goes to Malaca\u00f1ang, I\u2019ll open it up. For those who have valid reasons to complain about graft and corruption, the gates of Malaca\u00f1ang will be open. Doon ka. [applause] Mag-sumbong ka. At I will be briefed by my military or aide or yung si ano, itong nagbigay ng tubig. 'Sir, dito marami ka.' I have the reason why I do not go out. I do not accept invitations. Hindi ako tumatanggap because every time I travelled around Manila, it causes a huge congestion. Kasi pag itong pag-uwi ko, [inaudible] by projection. Paglabas ni presidente, ano yan, picture taking ganon. And they start to block the--- yung roads access to the...Ganon iyan. Everytime a president come out, ganon iyan. So, paparahin nila iyan, sasabihin nila, dadaan iyan by this time. And in the meantime, sarado yan. Paglabas ko, akala mo Biyernes Santo. Walang sasakyan diyan. Ikaw pala exponentially --- ang traffic, the tail end of the traffic is somewhere [inaudible] And it would take about two to three hours to normalize. Kaya hindi ako tumatanggap ng... And I hate to travel. Kasi talagang lilinisin eh. Ito namang\u2026 Kasi ang taas kasi ng entourage ng Presidente. Dulo sa dulo may ambulansya. Hindi lang entourage, parang [inaudible] Sabi ko: Dalawa, tatlo, tama na, sa gitna lang ako. Pero ang totoo, mag-taxi lang ako dito sa likod. Sunod lang ako. [laughter and applause] Eh takot man sila na\u2026 Ano naman ang makuha ko kung patayin mo ako? What for... May ambulansya doon. Dagdagan mo na ng punerarya. [laughter] I have also ordered the DFA to streamline documentary requirements and passport applications and open additional Consular Offices in strategic places to decongest Metro Manila sites [applause] and avoid queues that have caused hardships and suffering to passport applicants. I have also directed the newly-created DICT, Information and Communication Technology, to develop a National Broadband Plan to accelerate the deployment of fiber optics cables and wireless technologies to improve internet speed. [applause] Ito para ito sa\u2026 Alam ko, mahal kong mga kababayan, maligayahan kayo nito. Ipag-paano mo lang yung Tagalog ko kasi...Eh kayo hindi kayo marunong mag-Bisaya eh 'di...[laughter] Wi-Fi access shall be provided at no charge in selected public places [applause] including parks, plazas, public libraries, schools, government hospitals, train stations, airports and seaports. O \u2018di ba? [applause] Happy lahat. All government agencies are instructed to enable their clients to submit applications for coordination to other agencies combined. [Itaas mo, wala na yan. Ayaw ko nang mag-salita.] The national portal, yes, because it\u2019s our parang website.Ito: We shall intensify \u2014 mainit talaga ako dito \u2013 I place it in parity with drugs. We shall intensify our war against human traffickers and illegal recruiters that prey on our migrants.[applause] To help ensure that the hard-earned money of the Filipinos overseas are put into productive use, a mandatory financial education for all migrants and their communities will be pursued with incentives to encourage entrepreneurship among them. I may now also ask on Congress to consider drawing up bills consolidating and merging agencies and offices having to do the Overseas Filipino to have a department that shall focus on and quickly respond to their problems and concerns. Kailangan ko ng isa. [applause] And I have asked\u2026 I don\u2019t know if Secretary Bello is here, Bebot. Wala? Absinero talaga yan. [laughter] Maski sa Cabinet absinero yan. Gusto ko, he will rent or we\u2019ll lease some buildings here for overseas only. At lagyan ko ng \u2013 and they will direct all BIR, lahat na. BIR, lahat ng something to do with the clearances of the police, in one building, may booth lang. I said: My God! Make use of the computer. So doon lang siya mag-ikot sa isang building. Ang Pilipino, hindi na siya mag-punta doon sa Statistics. Hindi na siya punta doon sa ano, diyan, diyan sa opisina. Gamitin ninyo ang computer and you can get the results right after. Why do we have... Has to travel to Malate, then he will just stuck in the traffic. He can only accomplish one document at one time. NBI clearance is doon na ninyo ibigay. Lahat na doon na. At kung dapat, may-awa si Bello, pakainin niyo yung mga tao doon. Lalo na sa probinsya. Pagtingin ninyo taga-probinsya, finish it right away. Make use of the computer. O kapag hindi niyo ginamit yan, tapon na lang ninyo. Throw away your computers and I will understand that. It would take you years to do it. Do the computer.[Taas mo na yan. Wala na yan.] [laughter] Ito: To help avoid squatter-like conditions in relocation sites, we urge utilities like Meralco and electric cooperatives to exercise their social corporate responsibility by making direct connections to relocation sites and depressed areas. Alam mo kung bakit? Kaya nga nilagyan nila diyan e. That\u2019s why I had to talk to you ganito. 'Bakit?' It\u2019s because walang kuryente pagka mahirap ka. You do not own the land. That is my experience 23 years as mayor. Hindi magbigay ng direct connection. Kasi hindi ikaw ang may-ari ng lupa but that squatter, they have been there for 20 years. So mag-connect-connect sila. Pag ka-connect-connect nila, ang gamitin nila yung wire na, yung pinaka-mura. So it overheats because connect-connect na lang sila kung sino yung minsan magnakaw. You know, we will have to make the adjustments. It is not for these people to make the corrections because they are not in a position to do it. We have to adjust to the needs of our people. Total diyan naman yang sa squatter na yan, as long as I sit here as President, there will be there no demolitions without relocations. Hindi talaga ako papayag. [applause] Hindi naman aso yan na --- just like in Davao. I\u2019d like to make a dialogue with the businessmen. \u201cSir, how much are you investing in this land you have bought with the squatter?\u201d \"So, I bought it at about 60 million.\" Dagdagan mo ng 20 million. Ako na ang bahala. Sabihin ko doon sa mga tao, \"Bili tayo ng relocation site or I will provide.\" Government will expropriate. I will make use of the expropriation powers. Ako ganon sa Davao eh. I have 20 hectares there. I will expropriate some land there. Iyong malapit lang. Then sabihin ko: \"This 20 million will help your journey to a new land.\" And I will urge everybody na yung mga bagong mga factories, doon sila mag-tayo. Magtiis-tiis lang muna kayo. In the meantime,you have to mitigate the hardships of these people. That\u2019s the only way to do it. Sa demolition, walang matirahan ang tao. Tutal you sat on your rights for many years eh bakit mo ngayon, pipilitin mo ako magka-problema ng ganon? Eh may iba kasi, hinahayaan nila. Ten, 20 years, they do nothing. And when the time, comes, na pagbili lang nila, tayo na disturbuhin. O \u2018di gumastos ka para mas madali. Just add a little bit more and there will be at least peace. Pag hindi, wala yan. Fight na naman \u2018yan, between government and the tawag nila, \"squatters\". Squatters naman talaga yan. Masasaktan lang mamatay for no reason at all. Eh kung mayaman ka, bigyan mo ng konting ano, provide a relocation. And I\u2019ll be glad to talk to the people and say: \u201cGo. It is not yours.\u201d I have directed the concerned regulatory agencies to prioritize the issuance of required permits for power development. Okay \u2018yan sa akin. Ang problema sandali ito. [Para ka diyan.] Iyong mga environmentalist, meron tayong, meron tayong, ano kasi \u2013 marami ang coal. Pati yang... Ito nga, itong energy emissions, wala man akong problema diyan. But do not tell me na, if you... Ambassador ka tapos sabihin mo sa akin na, 'medyo hanggang diyan lang kayo, kasi kami hangang dito lang kami. ' Sabi ko, 'Ano? Kayo umabot diyan. You are now in the apex of your industrial might. But along the way, you were the first \u2013 America, China, Europe.' Kayong bomba-bomba, until now we contribute only something point zero. So, if you put so much restrictions doon sa treaty na yan, the treaty which we are trying to \u2013 it's still here in the Senate. Let us be very clear on this: We need to industrialize. We need the power and, therefore, the emissions would also be considered. You just can't say it: 'I established five economic zones here'. And you start to say that, 'you are spewing so much carbon footprints'. Mahirap yan. I mean, it's hard. I cannot just agree on anything that will delay. I\u2019m only good for six years. And I intend to do something during my term. Now, I\u2019m sure that the heavy machineries would come in and even the power, cheapest is coal. So ito naman locally, you get in trouble with Gina. So, we'll just talk sa Cabinet na lang. Si Gina naman is a very fine lady. Huwag ka lang magsimangot sa harapan niya. Bigyan ka niya permit maski lima. Magsimangot ka, zero. [laughter] Oo, just be gracious to her, that's all. It's a matter of talking and explaining to them. But if it is... You're using the state of the art technology and I\u2019ve seen it several times in the other power plants in this country. If it is really a good one, then we will consider, I said, because we need the energy to power our industrialization.[applause] To strengthen the delivery of social services, the government will intensify its protection programs, so it can use its resources, expertise to make a dent in the country\u2019s poverty levels. What we want is genuinely to reduce the vulnerabilities of our people, build resiliency and empower individuals, and families and communities. The beneficiaries of 4Ps shall be made to become independent and self-reliant after they have graduated from the program [applause]. But the aim is to present it with other forms of assistance, so that they can stand on their own two feet. But now, I have decided to direct the DSWD to provide the rice subsidies to the poorest of the families, at least, para makakain lang every month. [applause] Iyong sako na ano... We are planning to increase spending on basic education and incorporate mandatory education about the evils of drugs. We will also intensify and expand Alternative Learning System programs. The government will also provide universal health insurance for all Filipinos [applause].Benefits\u2013Sali na lang natin sa PhilHealth. The professional competence and operational capabilities of government hospitals and health facilities will be strengthened. Consistent with our international obligations, in keeping with national mandates, this administration vows to protect women\u2019s rights and human rights abuses [applause] against our women, because this unacceptable to... Kung mag-bugbog ka ng babae. Thus, I order all agencies and oversight bodies and local government units down to the barangay level to fully implement the Magna Carta for Women. [applause] By doing so, we'll ensure that man and woman will be partners in the pursuit of country\u2019s economic, social, and cultural and political developments. To our Lumad brothers, and they are here outside. Outside? They are here outside I\u2019m sure . I told the... Just to let them come if they want. Kanila man ito. To our brothers, I have this to say: The government has issued you the Ancestral Certificates Domain Title covering vast tracts of land especially in the Island of Mindanao. You have the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights Act, and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples to protect you and to assist you. Government has given you the tool, the legal tool to improve yourself financially, economically and socially. Make use of your ancestral domain. Do not let it remain idle. While the government is always ready to help you, you must first help yourself. We cannot legislate financial and economic progress for you. It is you and you alone who can do that. You can chart your fate, but do it within constitutional and legal means. After being devastated by natural and man-made calamities these past few years, we are still to recover emotionally from the loss of our loved ones, and materially from the loss of our homes and our income sources. There are many among us whose emotional wounds are still fresh and painful to the touch. We cannot erase the images of death and destruction from our minds. We cannot wash away the stench of rotting flesh from our noses. And there are many of us who are still waiting for the help that was promised. The enormity of the problem of drug addiction has been made manifest by the number of surrenderees which grows by the hundred each day that passes. Since July 1, we have already made 3,600 related drug arrests. 120,[000] drug dependents have already surrendered and 70,000 of them are pushers.You think this is just a... [applause] It could take the entire resources of this government to fight this war. I have nothing but the interest of my country. But let\u2019s wait because the PDEA says that \u2013 it's about the past statement made by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Two years ago, PDEA came out with a statement that there are 3 million drug addicts in this country. That was two or three years ago. How do you think \u2013 would the numberincrementallyif wecountnow? Give it a liberal addition. Maybe, gawin mo na [700,000]. So three million seven hundred thousand [3.7 million]. The number is quite staggering and scary. The drug lords that you desperately want to strangle are not here. Wala mga bilyonaryo dito. The ones that you catched, running after, are just thelieutenants. They do it with technology. They\u2019recooking it in the international waters. Itinatapon nila 'yan bulto, by the drums. Dikitan nila ng GPS. So makikita agad. We are hard put sa intelligence because they have invented this direct satellite. Hindi na magdadaan yan ng...All they have to do is to triangulate where the \u2013 pag-ikot niya. And there's so many \u2013 and they are in codes. If we do not help from our friends here in Asia and America, and Europe \u2013 this year number and problem, believe me, will drown us as a Republic. Kayo tingnan ninyo ito. How can I solve the problem now by arresting? Hinahanap... Kung matagal na akong Presidente, gusto kong patayin. Ang problema pupunta pa ako doon and I'll ask the permission from this country that I will go because I have to slaughter these idiots who are destroying my country. Ganoon yun eh. [inaudible] Presidente, ayaw ko naman bitawan, kasi ayaw naman kasi ng military, pati pulis. But you know, I said, \"I\u2019ll be talking in front of the Republic to its representatives, for the people\". So I have to tell you: \"How do we solve this problem?\" Can we? Ako naman okay lang eh. Make it public, fine. Make it confidential, if you go to me or go to you, to your house, okay. But that is really the enormity of the problem. It's so enormous that you are intimidated even just to make a move. Because you cannot stop it anyway. Mabunggo mo isa dito hinulog sa dagat, eh marami naman nagluluto doon. It\u2019s a free for all enterprise for the criminals at this time. Kung ako, if I had just the plan...Sabi ko, sabi ko sa military kapag nakita ninyo, pasabugin mo na. Maski nag-surrender yan, may white, white flag. Pang-giyera lang yan, hindi yan pang-kriminal, pasabugin mo. Show no mercy to them because they're not doing any mercy to us anyway. Bakit ako...Iyan ang problema. But we should not despair. Like someone wrote: It is when the night is darkest, that dawn breaks. We are imbued with resiliency that has been tested and proven. More difficult times As in the past. We have a bond to act together. We have to help each other. For then and only then can we truly prevail. And the Filipino, disciplined, informed, involved, shall rise from the rubbles of sorrow and pain. So that all the mirrors in the world will reflect the face of a passion that has changed this land.

In more than two hours, the President vowed that his administration's war on drugs would remain \"unrelenting,\" dismissed human rights campaigns by \"white\" advocates, told the United States to return Leyte's historic bells from World War II, warned uncooperative mining firms, attacked the media, criticized the Left with which he scrapped peace negotiations,and complained about temporary restraining orders issued by the Supreme Court being \"the bane of our inefficiency.\" There were issues he mentioned in his campaign and in his first SONA that he either skipped or barely mentioned in this year's speech, such as the shift to federalism and his administration's infrastructure program. (READ: HIGHLIGHTS: Issues mentioned in SONA 2017) Prominently, however, he asked Congress to \"act on all pending legislations to reimpose the death penalty on heinous crimes \u2014 especially on the trafficking of illegal drugs.\" Below is the full text of President Duterte's SONA 2017. *** Kindly sit down. Thank you for your courtesy. When I was a member of Congress, I \u2013my seat was over there. The seat... The lady with a violent \u2013 not violent but rather violet dress \u2013 seated. But I was always absent together with the Speaker and Tonyboy Floirendo, who is still absent until today. [laughter] And that started\u2026 Ay nandiyan ba? Sorry. But his propensity started almost 17 years ago when we were members of the 11th Congress. Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III and the members of the Senate; Pantaleon Alvarez, the Speaker and the members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; Former Presidents Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada, and former President Gloria Arroyo; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno of the Supreme Court and the members of courts; Archbishop Pinto and the distinguished guests of the diplomatic corps; Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; my fellow workers in government; my countrymen. When I took my oath of office a year or so ago, I knew that our country was reeling from a multitude of problems. That day, there was euphoria in the air resulting from a successful campaign and the thought that dominated my being was to make good on my promise to the people to bring change in government, not a change that is passing but a change that can survive the test of time. Although I still had to know the magnitude and gravity of the problems, my feeling then was that, equipped with political will and braced by a concerned citizenry, those problems would eventually be bested by us. It was only a matter of determination and collective action. It was only a question of time. For as I saw it then as I see it now, there is no problem in the world which can stop the march of a people with unflinching and tenacious determination. That was how euphoric \u2013 euphoric it has been. Early on, I felt that if change was to be meaningful, it had to start with those occupying the highest positions in government because change that comes from below is more transitory than permanent. And I was aiming for permanence. Let change trickle down from [top to] bottom. It has to be a change that is not confined merely to the replacement of people by people, but a change in the people\u2019s attitude, disposition and work ethic. Sadly, although we knew years ago that what was needed or ought to do, we did not do [them] because our idea of government was parochial and we could not rise above family, ethnic and clan loyalties as well as loyalty to friends and co-workers. No one wanted to be a snitch. That is why we are one in saying that genuine change is what this country truly needs. I believed then, as I believe still, that progress and development will sputter if criminals, illegal drugs, illegal users of drugs are allowed to roam the streets freely, victimizing seeming with impunity, the innocent and the helpless. Worse yet, there were times in the past when the protectors of the people were themselves the perpetrators of the very crimes they were tasked to prevent or suppress. It is ironic as it is madness. I have learned that economy surges only when there is peace and order prevailing in places where investors can pour their capital and expertise. I have learned from my experience in Davao City that investor confidence [is] bolstered and fortified only if a potent force and mechanism for protection of local and foreign investments are in place. That is why, I have resolved that no matter how long it takes, the fight against illegal drugs will continue because that is the root cause of so much evil and so much suffering [applause] that weakens the social fabric and deters foreign investments from pouring in. The fight will be unremitting as it will be unrelenting. Despite international and local pressures, the fight will not stop [applause] until those who deal in it understand that they have to cease, they have to stop because the alternatives are either jail or hell. [applause] And I will make sure, very sure that they will not have the luxury of enjoying the benefits of their greed and madness. I do not intend to loosen the leash in the campaign or lose the fight against illegal drugs. Neither do I intend to preside over the destruction of the Filipino youth by being timid and tentative in my decisions and actions. [applause] To the critics against this fight, your efforts will be better spent if you use the influence, moral authority and ascendancy of your organizations over your respective sectors to educate the people on the evils of illegal drugs instead of condemning the authorities and unjustly blaming for every killing that bloodies this country. But don\u2019t get me wrong. I value human life the way I value mine. Each life that is snuffed out translates into future generations lost. It is like cracking the acorn from which an oak tree grows \u2013 which, in turn, produce the seeds to complete the cycle of [life in] perpetuity. There is a jungle out there. There are beasts and vultures preying on the helpless, the innocent [and] the unsuspecting. I will not allow the ruin of the youth, the disintegration of families and the retrogression of communities, forced by criminals whose greed for money is as insatiable as it is devoid of moral purpose. Neither will I be immobilized into inaction by the fear that I will commit an act that will expose me to public condemnation or legal prosecution. You harm the children in whose hands the future of this Republic is entrusted, and I will hound you to the very gates of hell. [applause] That is why I ask you to join me in this fight against illegal drugs and all forms of criminality. The government, equipped with legal authority, and you, with the moral ascendancy over the sector you represent, can do so much, and hopefully eradicate this social scourge that plagues us no end. Look beyond your biases, your prejudices, your ambition, your political agenda. The search for change will begin and end only when we look into ourselves and find it within. Today, a multitude of problems confront us. No sooner is one problem solved [when] another surges forth in its place. But we will not be disheartened; we will not be cowed; we will not be overwhelmed. It is during trying times and troubled events that the resilience, perseverance and determination of the people are tested. The Filipino is no stranger or neophyte to situations like the one we face today. We can, and we will, overcome as we did countless times in the past, [but] only if we work together towards a common goal. Sad to say, despite all efforts, peace, especially in the Island of Mindanao, continues to elude us. But of course, it is not the peace of the dead but the peace of the living that we seek. Peace flits away like a butterfly when you try to snatch it by the wings. And our pursuit of peace continues. The red insurgency has been with us for decades; the Muslim issue, for centuries. So much time has lapsed, so many lives have been lost and so much destruction has been wrought but peace eludes us still. Sometimes I am almost tempted to conclude that peace might not be able to come during our lifetime. But believe me, it will not be for want of trying. And I will persist in our goal of attaining peace [up] to the last day of this administration and maybe even beyond although in a different capacity. [applause] There is rebellion in Mindanao. The extremists have declared it their purpose to establish a caliphate within Philippine territory along the teachings and beliefs of [the] Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or otherwise known as ISIS. The battle of Marawi has dealt a terrible blow to our quest for peace especially now that an alien ideology and a radical shift in purpose have been injected into the local setting. I declared Martial Law in Mindanao because I believed that that was the fastest way to quell the rebellion at the least cost of lives and properties. [applause] At the same time, the government would be adequately equipped with the constitutional tool not only to prevent the escape of rebels who can easily mingle and pretend to be civilian evacuees only to re-group in another place to fight another day, but also to prevent them from spreading their gospel of hate and violence in the rest of Mindanao. Martial Law and the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus enable the military to arrest, detain and question suspected members and sympathizers of the rebellion similar to what happened to the parents of the Maute brothers. As president, I am reiterating my unwavering support and commitment to the soldiers of our Armed Forces and the members of our police force \u2013[applause] those who are on the ground and in the battlefields and those who are risking their lives for our country and our democracy. I have your backs. To those who oppose and think that all these efforts are out of order, I hold myself \u2013 me and me alone should be responsible. [applause] The people of Marawi need help. Caught in the crossfire between government troops and Muslim extremists, they have been through hell and we need to help them rise and move forward. If we cannot provide for the poor and the needy who are many, then we will not be able to keep from harm the rich who are few. At the vanguard of our struggle for peace and order are our Armed Forces and Police. They are the silent heroes who risk their lives everyday for our country\u2019s security. In recognition of their valor, we have crafted a program to provide them with comprehensive social assistance, including financial, should they meet harm in the performance of their duty. For the family left behind by those who fell or are rendered totally disabled in the line of duty, we shall provide shelter, health care assistance, education, and employment. That is my way of telling our troops: never fear, do your duty. I stand behind you. So does this government and all its agencies. [applause] To decisively address insurgency and terrorism, we are working doubly hard towards [achieving] a stronger and more credible national defense system for the country. We continue to strengthen the defense capability of the AFP as a deterrence against terrorists, lawless elements, and other threats. My fellow citizens, what I have said so far about the events in Marawi and its neighboring environs is only a part of a looming problem, which will cut across all classes and all sectors of society and eventually affect the entire country from north to south, from east to west, given the fact that Mindanao supplies a great part of our country\u2019s food requirements. I refer to climate change, which could bring drought and long dry spells affecting food production in Mindanao, given the fact that Mindanao is unusually warming. I ask all agencies involved in food production to look into this and act accordingly. Also, I am appealing to all our legislators to immediately pass the National Land Use Act or NALUA [applause] to ensure the rational and sustainable use of our land and our physical resources, given the competing needs of food security, housing, businesses and environmental conservation. Ours is a rich country. Wealth that this country is endowed with [is] a gift from God to be utilized for the [people\u2019s] welfare and the common good. I do not believe that this gift was given to us to be merely viewed or appreciated, but to be extracted from the earth and utilized to make life worth living. That is why I say that it is not enough that we mine this wealth. What is more important is that we convert the raw material thereof into finished products for international and local purposes. [applause] That way, it will not only be the few who are the rich but also the poor who are many who will benefit therefrom. Therefore, I call on our industrialists, investors [and] commercial barons to put up factories and manufacturing establishments right here in the Philippines to process our raw materials into finished products. [applause] At this point in my administration, if possible, we shall put a stop to the extraction and exportation of our mineral resources to foreign nations [applause] for processing abroad and importing them back to the Philippines in the form of consumer goods at prices twice or thrice the value of the original raw materials foreign corporations pay for them. However, in the extraction and utilization of these resources, extreme care must be exercised [applause] that we do not recklessly and needlessly harm the environment. [applause] Responsible, regulated and sustainable development is what we advocate and require. The protection of the environment must be made a priority [applause] ahead of mining and all other activities that adversely affect one way or another. And this policy is non-negotiable. [applause] I sternly warn\u2026. I am warning all mining operations and contractors to refrain from the unbridled and irresponsible destruction of our watersheds, forests, and aquatic resources. You have gained much from mining, we only get about 70 billion a year, but you have considerably neglected your responsibility to protect and preserve \u2013 and even the tax, it\u2019s about five percent \u2013 environment for posterity. I am holding all mining companies and its officials responsible for the full and quick clean-up, restoration [and] rehabilitation of all areas damaged by mining activities, and the extension of all necessary support to the communities that have suffered mining\u2019s disastrous effects on their health, [applause] livelihood, and environment, among others. Ganito \u2018yan eh. Medyo alis muna ako diyan sa\u2026.Sasakit ang mata ko diyan sa y*** na \u2018yan. [laughter] Alam mo, you have the mining. I have to grant you a mining because you have complied with all the requirements of the law. And I cannot\u2026 I\u2019d be subject to a mandamus if everything is perfect and you have every right to mine. But in doing so, you destroy the rivers, you destroy the streams, from which the poor people fish \u2013 halwan or mudfish \u2013 and that is protein for the day for them. Ngayon makita mo naman not only Gina Lopez gave you a clear picture of what was happening horrendously. Nakita mo kay Ted Failon \u2013 \u2019yung kay Ted Failon, talagang nanood ako, dalawang beses. And I realized that I have to do something about it as a Filipino. [applause] Alam mo, okay na \u2018yung mining. Subsidiary ka lang ng isang another giant corporation or you\u2019re a sister company of a telecommunication, hindi kayo magugutom. But look at the picture shown to you. For once, they behaved correctly ang ABS-CBN. Tingnan mo \u2018yung pelikula ni Ted Failon. I salute him for coming with it. [applause] You see the palayan\u2026 Ang palayan tumuyo at ang soil nag-crack. So the farmers cannot eat anymore. They are reduced to the garbage of what you can get there, salvage anything and sell it to the scrap. Ganun ang nangyari sa Pilipino. Hindi ko kayo kalaban. As a matter of fact, you give government almost 70 billion. Pero actually maliit lang \u2019yan. Ngayon, nakikita ninyo itong mga palayan na tumutuyo and the rivers wala ng isda. The only source of protein. Hindi ka naman pwedeng mag-hunting. May makita kang eagle diyan, barilin mo, preso ka. Pakainin mo \u2018yung\u2026 Saan mo ipa\u2026? Try to go out, sumama tayo \u2013 kayo sa akin. And try to see how hard it is for them to survive. Now ito ang\u2026 Gusto mo ganito ang pangyayari, tutal sobra-sobra naman \u2018yang pera ninyo, 'adre, sa totoo lang. Mayor ako eh, I can look at your corporate earnings, your sister company, I can pierce the corporate identity, kayo rin pala. And even diyan sa mga newspaper. When you are not supposed to\u2026 You know, \u2018pag newspaper ka you are supposed to be 100 percent Filipino. And yet when you start to pierce their identity, it is pala fully owned by Americans. Ganun ang nangyari eh. It\u2019s just a matter of piercing the\u2026 So wala masyado ako\u2026 ABS, Rappler kayo ba \u2018yan? Have you tried to pierce your identity and it will lead you to America? Do you know that? And yet the Constitution requires you to be 100 percent \u2013 media \u2013 Filipino. Rappler, try to pierce the identity and you will end up American ownership. Mayaman na kayo, mga mining companies. Ito ang deal ko sa inyo, either I will raise the taxes, ang kumikita niyan i-reserve ko to compensate for those who are suffering and in agony. [applause] You have to come up with a substitute, either spend to restore the virginity of their source or I will tax you to death. [applause] Kasi \u2018yung taxes makuha ko, talagang ibubuhos ko. Ngayon, if you can make an arrangement, an inventory of the \u2013 \u2019yung nasira \u2013 \u2019yung mga tao nagutom pati \u2018yung river nila wala nang makuha because\u2026 You know guys, kayong mga taga-Davao we are not new to it, you want to see horror in your lifetime? Akong bahala. NPA huwag muna kayong magpagara-gara diyan, away-away kay magpunta kami samahan ko sila. You stop your \u2013 puro hambog lang kayo diyan. Punta tayo doon sa Diwalwal, doon sa [inaudible] and I will show you the river. Up there at the source, it\u2019s so pristine. But doon sa \u2013 right at the start of the boundary where the millings are started, the water there is not clear, it is not brown, it is black. Your one peso will win one million from me if I am lying. Kung gusto mo isama ko kayo bukas doon. Ngayon, \u2018pag tinarget tayo ng mga g***** NPA na \u2018yan eh problema natin \u2018yan lahat. Sabay-sabay na lang tayo. Bakante ang presidency, bakante ang Senado pati ang congressman. Pero totoo \u2018yan, you should visit the\u2026 Even the first spade, even the first spade full of earth that you extract and throw it away of no use. Itabi mo lang \u2018yan diyan eh because it\u2019s an open pit, you dig and dig and dig, is already the first spade there is the decreasing of Mother Earth. Alam mo ang isa pang galit sa mining? Si Speaker. He comes from a mining town but he hates mining. Ako naman kasi mga kaibigan ko \u2018yung iba, \u2018yung mga classmate ko mga vice president ng mining, magpunta sila dito\u2026 But it reduces into something \u2013 the damage that you have caused. It\u2019s not about our friendship. It\u2019s not about years of being in the same room. It\u2019s not about being fraternity brothers. But it is something that\u2026 [raises his right hand] Ganun \u2019yan eh. Alam mo \u2018yung martial law, I am not so much endeavored diyan sabihin ninyo na hindi ninyo ibigay? Okay lang. Wala akong problema diyan. Maski sabihin ninyo na tama na? Okay lang. Then I will still fight. The way I will fight the war. If it is not acceptable to the normal of civilian conduct, then I am sorry because I am not fighting a civilian war, I am stopping violence and rebellion. [applause] Hindi talaga ako\u2026 Ibigay man ninyo o hindi, para sa akin wala. Because ako, I do not intend to go beyond my term. As a matter of fact, mas gusto kong barilin ako doon sa likod. Eh hindi masyado ako itong bilib itong trabahong ito? Akala ko bilib ako. Pagdating ko ah l****, sakit ng ulo. [applause] Totoo. Kayo nakikinig kayo. Wala akong pinirmahan ni isa, p**** i**** \u2019yan na para pagkain. Pagkain-pagkain sa opisina, eh bayaran ninyo \u2018yan. Maglabas ako. I do not collect anything. I do not remember. I do not sign anything there until now. Wala akong allowance wala akong tinatanggap lahat except my salary. Tapos dalawang pamilya pa ang maghati. Anong masama niyan? [applause and cheers] Sige kayo pakpak diyan. Lahat naman tayo. [laughter] I can count my\u2026 Not even the two hands, one hand lang na exempted sa rule na \u2018yan. Dalawa, tatlo, apat, lima. Lokohin ninyo ako, ba\u2019t tayo pa ba ang maglokohan? Just because this is Congress it has to be a secret, secret. Maniwala kayong mga ito? Pareho kaming lahat niyan. Ayaw pa tumawa kunwari. [laughter and applause] So I will increase the taxes. Then I will think of something that will compensate or make up for the damage or at least the income restored. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to stop mining. I will ask you to stop it. It\u2019s not good. We are a small group of islands, hindi naman marami. The coastal, marami \u2018yan kasi marami paikot-ikot, but we are in a contiguous territory, maliit lang tayo. You must remember that there are so many billions of the future generations waiting in this stratosphere. Ang gusto ninyo para hindi na kayo mandamay, huminto na kayo ng ano. Then let us go to\u2026 Because this will not end here. How about the billions and billions and billions of Filipinos who will come after us? Kawawa naman. They\u2019ll have to scratch Mother Earth to eat. By this time kung walang upheaval, no regeneration will occur, we are almost like talagang ginaganun natin ang \u2013maliit na lang ang makuha nila. But maawa naman kayo. Makikita mo \u2018yung apo mo kung ganun mo na lang\u2026 Kung ganun mo na lang \u2018yung \u2013 embrace mo \u2018yung apo mo sa pangalawang asawa. \u2018Yung isa ganun rin. \u2018Di ba? \u2018Di ba, sir? [laughter] Suntukin kita diyan ngayon, liar ka. Finally, let me make this appeal to those directly engaged in mining. Declare your correct income [and] pay your correct taxes. Believe me, your failure to do so will be your undoing and eventual ruin. [applause] Hindi na ako makatakbo, matanda na ako. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll even survive the five years. Pero pagka sinabi ko upakan kita, upakan talaga kita. To our employees and officials of the LGUs tasked with monitoring these mining operations within their territorial jurisdictions, do your job without fear or favor. I [hold] you absolutely responsible for any misdeed or failure [by] the mining entities to comply \u2013 do not comply or comply with the guidelines, rules and regulations governing mining operations and activities within your area of responsibility. I mean it. Do not try to test my resolve. Absolutely I have nothing to lose except my life. While we can control the acts of man, no one can control [or] stop the fury and rampage of weather gone wild. When nature fights back, it does so with a vengeance. We have seen the terrible toll that Super typhoon Yolanda and the succeeding typhoons exacted in terms of human life and property. And we still have to recover from the beating that we got both during and in the aftermath of those mega-typhoons. Aside from droughts, tempests and other problems taking shape which, according to DOST-PHIVOLCS \u2013 it is no longer just a distant possibility but a probability: Earthquakes. The series of damaging quakes in Leyte, Surigao and nearby provinces and islands attest to this. We were told that it is no longer a question of \u201cif\u201d but a matter of \u201cwhen.\u201d Thus, we need to act decisively and fast because the threat is huge, real and imminent. Come to think of it really, they say that there is no perfect instrument or human acumen can really predict earthquake. I hope it will not come. Kasi kung magdating \u2019yung sabi nila \u2018yung \u201cBig One\u201d, I hope it will be just in the mountains and in the rural areas. Because if it\u2019s right \u2013 sabihin nila tinatakot nila ang\u2026 Media kasi\u2026 Nandito eh in the speech, I reviewed it last night. I am calling [on] both houses of Congress to expeditiously craft a law establishing a new authority or department that is responsive to the prevailing 21st century conditions and empowered to best deliver [an] enhanced disaster resiliency and quick disaster response. While the law is [being] crafted with extreme urgency, we need to undertake immediate action to ensure disaster resiliency and effective response in the greater [Metro] Manila area, which is our country\u2019s seat of governance, center of business, commerce, and the academe. Disaster resiliency of Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces is a matter of urgent [national ] concern. Iyon nandito \u2018yan, tinatakot nila dito because of the high-rise buildings and\u2026 Ilang tao ang nakatira diyan? Kung\u2026 Kaya kaya ito sa isang sinkhole? I mean if it cracks and it goes down, can we still manage to go up? God, huwag ngayon ha kay nandito ako. Hintayin mo lang \u2018yan sila na lang sila dito nag-aaway. [laughter] I am directing the Cabinet Cluster on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management to immediately work hand in hand with the concerned LGUs, the private sector and the affected communities themselves, in undertaking disaster [resiliency] measures, antidotes. We all need to act fast. With all the foregoing said, what then is the state of the nation today? I will mince no words and neither will I window-dress the situation [that] we are in. Let me answer in two brief sentences. We are in for trouble because we live in troubled and uncertain times. And I fear that things might get worse before they become better. But like I said I hope we will cope, we hope and pray. The West Philippine Sea issue and federalism are matters that we have to tackle sooner or later. On the other hand, despite our recent gains in improving the peace and order situation in the country, there is still so much to be desired and if we are to completely eradicate the menace of illegal drugs, criminality and corruption, we must do it. I therefore ask Congress to act on all pending legislations to reimpose the death penalty on heinous crimes \u2014 especially on the trafficking of illegal drugs. There is a shortage\u2026 No, no, no. There is a short clip of CNN about people in Massachusetts, was it there? Iyong clip nila ang ipinakita. Tiningnan\u2026 Pakitingin lang\u2026 It\u2019s repeated for almost every week yata \u2018yang mga short clips. Tingnan mo \u2018yung mga tao doon na hinayaan nilang mag\u2026 They are there, they live under the bridge, they are getting thin, they are doing nothing. Nakaganun lang sila tapos po-pose ng ano\u2026 And they are aplenty there. They do not work, wala. Tapos sabi ng UN\u2026 Is he here? Are you there iyong UN representative? Na sinabi mo na shabu will not affect the brain? Are you here? Raise your right hand, if you\u2019re here. Do not worry. I will just\u2026 Do not \u2013 the word \u201cdelude\u201d as into you\u2026 Iyong mga ano ninyo na \u2013 but we know everyday that one family raped, dalawa and all are dead. Then you trivialize it with human rights and due process. Okay ako niyan. When you go into an anger, when you burst with rage, okay \u2018yan. But with so many killings as brutal and as cruel as what happened, if you add human rights and due process, you stink and your mouth smells. If you want to criticize, criticize, condemn the act, stop there. But do not give the excuse or do not make it trivial by saying human rights at least we\u2019ll be protected... Iyan ang pinakab***** na magawa ng isang tao. When you criticize, stick on one topic. Then you find an event where you can talk about human rights and due process, but do not talk about it in the same time when there is a carnage and you begin to blabber, talk about human rights. Lalong nagagalit ang tao. Eh p****** i** mo. May namatay na diyan, akala mo kung sino ka. [applause] What have you done in the name of human rights? Seventy-seven \u2013 you have the records. You can summon the police. Seventy-seven before I became president. All drug- related, 77,000. And you trivialize that with a conference\u2026 At tsaka pumunta dito ang tatanungin \u2018yung nasa presuhan na pinireso dahil nag \u2013 just imagine\u2026 I challenge you, you want a debate in public? Okay, we\u2019ll have it. I will challenge you how also you trivialize the thing by \u2013 \u2019yung binibigyan niyo ng importansiya si De Lima. You all know, you were all here. You conducted the investigation. You heard the witnesses. You saw the videos. Is she a credible woman? Can she be a moral person? [applause] Puro kayo drama diyan sa\u2026 When you talk about an incident, talk about it, then condemn, condemn the police. But do not connect it with due process and human rights. Mag-mukha kang g*** sa harap ng Pilipino. You know why I get this rating? I could not be brighter than you and my work is not more important or your vocation is not less than mine. But when you talk in public carry the proper message. Kaya mag-82 kayo or kaya binobombahan niyo kasi ako ng ganun. Sasabihin naman ng mga tao, \u201cEh tama \u2018yan. Tama \u2018yan si Duterte.\u201d Kasi nangyayari eh. Eh kayo man ang front sa pa-ganun-ganun, eh \u2018pag may namatay diyan na maraming massacre, ni-rape mga babae, bata, hindi kayo umiimik. [applause] Maya-maya pagdating ng mga \u2013 [applause and cheers] pagdating nitong mga Western expert kuno, you give them so much premium and importance. Saan ba ang utak ninyo? Bakit kayo bilib diyan sa puti? Tingnan mo ang puti, panahon ni Obama, una \u2018yung spokesman ng State Department. Akala mo kung sino. Akala nila mas bright pa sila sa akin. Then the staff of the President, then Obama.\u201cI would like to remind Mr. Duterte that the policy of\u2026\u201d Eh \u2018di yari ako. Pagdating ni Trump, \u201cOh yes, Mr. President, I\u2019ve been expecting your call. You are doing it all right\u2026 And this G*******\u2026\u201d [applause] Uwi na ako. T**** i*** \u2018yan. So? That\u2019s the value of the country that you value. Ambivalent. Parang electric fan. Okay dito o hindi na okay, it\u2019s vacillating. Tapos kayong mga \u2013 bilib kayo. Hindi ko talaga maintindihan ang Pilipino. It takes for an American to say that I\u2019m a son of a b****. And it takes for an American to say, \u201cOh you\u2019re great. You\u2019re a hero in your country.\u201d O saan ako pumunta dito ngayon? [laughter] It is time for us to fulfill our mandate to protect our people from these crimes that have victimized\u2026 You know, huwag ninyo akong takot-takutin niyang preso \u2018yung international court of justice. S***, I am willing to go to prison for the rest of my life. Ang importante sa akin ginagaw ko \u2018yung gusto ko. [applause] Alam mo kasi in this country it is a rule of majority. I did it for the 50 plus one because in a vote of 100, I get 51, 50 plus one. Fifty is one-half, one, that is majority of one, I win. \u2018Yung 49, \u2018yon \u2018yung mga\u2026 I do not have to make them happy. But when the time comes, eh kung malasin ako, pupunta ako sa presuhan, do not worry about me. I can take it. Noong maliit pa ako, labas-pasok ako sa\u2026 Wala pa \u2018yang law ni Pangilinan. Labas-pasok na ako sa presuhan. Kunin ninyo \u2018yung record sa pulis doon sa Davao. Takutin na, \u201cHe will be prosecuted.\u201d Hoy, abogado ako because I will\u2026 Sabi ko nga, everybody is entitled to come here and question me, but I have to question you also. At para magaling, let us make it official. We go to court and we tell the judge that we are hearing by an international body, can we have it judicially recorded? And I will place them under oath. Mahuli ko man talaga \u2018yan sila. May pinatay ako, tama \u2018yan. When I was mayor, a little over\u2026 For 23 years ako mayor ng Davao eh. Makita mo ang Davao ngayon, you have been LGUs before. What city is now hitting nine growth percent? Eh nandoon pa kami sa Mindanao, binobomba pa kami sa Davao. Davao is nine growth. Tapos sabihin ninyo\u2026 Ngayon, paano ngayon i-nine mo \u2018yung \u2013 palabas mo itong nine we are about to hit six or so, sabi nila. Pero \u2018pag hayaan mo lang ako, mag-abot ito ng 21, the highest in the world. [applause] Kayo lang ang taga-pigil eh. It is time for us to fulfill our mandate to protect\u2026 Tapos na \u2018yan. Kindly\u2026 For so long\u2026 We have to act decisively on this contentious issue. Capital punishment is not only about deterrence. It is also about retribution. Make no mistake about that. Iba kasi ako eh. Let us understand each other including the international community. Ang aming \u2013 our criminal system uses the Revised Penal Code. That is a law that was given to us by the Spaniards, the original Revised Penal Code. Though it was translated into English and in this two books, three books, there are the definition of crimes and the penalties and everything. And the thrust of that Revised Penal Code, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of retribution. That is why you have penalties. There is also the word \u201cpositivist theory\u201d that you can nurture a criminal into goodness provided he goes to prison for two years, three years, he\u2019s released, he\u2019s a sex offender. When he goes out, he rapes again, kidnaps another girl and makes her a hostage for so many years. Ganun kayo eh. Admit it, ganun kayo. You are so too lenient about this son of a b****, a human being that has a virulent brain and his enemy is society. And many at times, there were sex offenders in America released only to rape and kidnap again and kill in just a few months after release. In the Philippines, it is really an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. You took a life then you must pay for life. That is the only way to even. You cannot place a premium on the human mind that he will go straight. Nobody can. Not even your best scientist. No one has ever fathomed how a person would react especially in committing crimes. That\u2019s the only way to do it to instill fear, that if you do it, you will die. That\u2019s the advantage of criminals and rebels and terrorists because they think that you are afraid to die. That\u2019s why when I went to Marawi, I was asked by the media, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d \u201cI am here because my soldiers are here and I came here to die also.\u201d [applause] Because any battle, any fierce encounter, you have to be of equal equanimity. Gusto siyang mamatay, eh \u2018di gusto ko ring mamatay. They say that they use the name of God, and the Christians say, \u201cwe have the same thing.\u201d I read the Ecclesiastes 3. What does it say? Even during elections, there is a time to be great and a time for defeat. A time to be in the skies, emblazoned there and a time to be [inaudible] somebody. A time to have money, a time to be hard up. A time to just walk so many kilometers to school and a time for graduation and being a lawyer. A time to be\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I am now. There\u2018s always a time. [laughter and applause] Ganun \u2018yan eh. So I\u2019ll match you. \u2018Pag sinabi mong, \u201cGusto kong mamatay.\u201d Anak ka ng\u2026 Dalawa tayo. This bully, you know I had dinner with them sa Bayan. Itong NDF because I used to be friends really with the NDF. I was crossing the ideological borders before. Ako \u2018yung nakakapasok sa teritoryo and we were friends really. But times have changed because God placed me here and I take care of a Republic. Sabi nila doon \u201cbully\u201d daw ako. T******* pala kayo, talagang bully ako. [laughter and applause] P***** i**. Talagang bully ako especially to the enemies of the state, talagang bully ako. [applause] Ito pa, sabi ko sa mga sundalo, \u2018yung mga human rights na ano, you are flying everywhere, anywhere \u2018yung mga utak ninyo. I said, \u201cTake no prisoners.\u201d Which is [garbled] \u2013 \u201ckill them\u201d. Which is correct? But you don\u2019t listen to my speech. This media \u2013 lalo na itong ABS \u2013 kunin lang \u2018yang, \u201ckill them.\u201d [laughter] \u2019Yan ang problema ninyo kaya minura ko kayo. Walang Presidente na p*******i** kayo because you are not behaving. Now you\u2019re asking me for talks\u2026 [applause and cheers] When you publish in the newspaper or quote us in media, itong mga reporters would only quote \u201ckill them.\u201d I said, \u201cKill them in a fight. If you have to shoot them, shoot them at the heart or the head.\u201d Sabi ko. Why? Because they will be detained here in Marawi, wala tayong presuhan. [laughter] ngayon, and the courts will always insist that they will be \u2013 that\u2019s the law \u2013 that they will be tried and detained in the place where they committed the crime. Kaya huwag kayong mag \u2013 patayin talaga ninyo, kasi ilagay natin \u2018yan diyan sa barracks natin diyan, sa ating Mechanized Division. Pag-eskapo niyan, dalhin \u2018yung kanyon natin, ipaputok pa sa atin. [laughter] Marami. How many jail \u2013 [anong tawag dito?] \u2013 jailbreaks in Mindanao, in Cotabato alone? Six. Cotabato City, four. Ang jail doon, nire-raid tapos pinapalabas. Alam ba ninyo \u2019yan? Because you do not publish. Or itong mga taga-Maynila\u2026 Hindi kayo, mga bright kayo, bilib ako. Mga g****g****. Sabi na \u201cWhy do you\u2026?\u201d Why? What happened last April in Davao? It was bombed. How many were killed? Twenty-seven. Few years ago, the church was bombed twice. How many died? Fifty-nine. The airport just as the people were coming out of the departure \u2013 ah arrival \u2013 it was bombed. How many died? Thirty-two. In the wharf 3, nuns were lining up there. I had to scoop the brain of the nun to put it in a can because the face was shattered. Zamboanga. And you say that the violation is only in Marawi? Torpe. Talaga kayong\u2026 Mag-usap tayo ngayon. Dalhin ko kayo doon sa mga biyuda. Kailan lang \u2019yun? Huwag niyong sabihin na \u201cIt\u2019s only in Marawi.\u201d Rebellion has been going on in Mindanao. Walang sinasanto doon. Hindi lang ninyo binabasa nang husto. What\u2019s the\u2026 It\u2019s very porous. Kung separate islands \u2018yan, maybe. Kung separate \u2019yan \u2013 very porous, they can go\u2026 And Mindanao \u2013 this is not to\u2026 The Moro has nothing to do with it, pareho tayo. Pareho tayong Maranao, so just shut up. Huwag kayong ma\u2026 Ito ang totoo. Maraming Muslim sa Mindanao. Lahat\u2026 Eh sa Abra, meron eh. In this fight\u2026.Well, where do you think the Moro would side? Kung patayan na. They will side with government? Kung ako ngayon, kung nakatira ako, hindi kami umalis ng \u2013hindi ako dinala ng nanay ko sa labas. I\u2019ll be a resident of Marawi, what do you think will be my sentiment? Sulu. Davao, puro Muslim enclaves \u2018yan, there are enclaves, parang baryo-baryo. Kapag sentimiyento ang putukan, magputok \u2018yan sabay-sabay. On another thing, I\u2019ll talk it about in the conference. Sumobra itong Left eh. Maggawa ka ng bahay \u2013 nakawin. Ang sabi ko sa sundalo, \u201cDo not force the issue. I will just build yours. Ibigay mo na lang.\u201d May project ngayon, gusto na naman nilang kuhanin. Do not commit that mistake. Here and now, I will tell you, including the Congress of the Republic of the Philippines: You do anarchy, I will order the soldiers and the police to shoot. Even if I have to bury thousand of Filipinos. Huwag ninyo akong ganunin. Either you\u2019re\u2026 Either\u2026 Let us understand this beginning today, either we have laws in this country or we do not. We enforce the laws against the miners and the rich, but I will also enforce laws against anarchy, disturbance, and create trouble. Kayo rin, natatakot din eh. [applause] Takutin ninyo ako na occupy the streets? Anak ng jueteng. You stay there, you ask for two days, I will give you six months. Huwag kayong umalis diyan. Kainin ninyo pati \u2018yung dumi ninyo diyan. Takut-takutin mo ang gobyerno. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve exceeded my time, but\u2026 Eh kailangan kong sabihin eh. Para maintindihan din nila. Tutal nandito na lang rin ako sa media. Nakikinig pati lahat. Kayong mga Left, I will not talk to you. Why should I? [applause] Huwag mo na akong pilitin na magpatayo kayo mga pro-poor, shut up. Wait for two years, because I have\u2026 You know, this is my proposal. I may be totally wrong and I will accept it, but this is mine. From now on, I will save money for the Armed Forces of the Philippines. We have lost so much soldiers. [applause] And there are thousands already incapacitated to fight. Pati \u2019yung police ko, araw-araw ninyong ina-ambush. Pati ang convoy ko, kasi doon ako mag-sakay, ina-ambush nila. Pati akong \u2013 g***. P*****i**, pati ako, patayin nila. Sabagay, malayo ako doon. Pero convoy ko kasi \u2018yun eh. Waiting lang ako doon sa ano\u2026 Alam mo ginamitan niyo ng machine gun. Kaya lang armorized. Kayong mga congressman, senador na ayaw ninyong \u2013 baka may kalaban kayo. Asawa ba ninyo \u2018yung katira ninyo ngayon? [laughter] O inagaw ninyo? Pa-armorize ninyo. Totoo. Proven, M60. [applause] Si\u2026 Si Senator Drilon, M60, sir. Hindi talaga \u2018to maalis. Kasi binara na nila. Nasira na lang \u2018yung \u2013 \u2018di talaga nila. And the soldiers inside were all there all the time, mina-machine gun na, hindi tatalab. Mga g***, pati \u2018yung convoy ko, ambushin. Hindi nila alam na nakasibat na ako. [applause] Kaya gusto niyo kong mag-usap tayo, no, sumobra kayo. Ikaw, Sison, tang \u2026 Mag-inom ka ng Tang \u2018yung orange. [laughter] Matanda ka na. Kayong Pilipinas, makinig, buong Pilipinas. Kayong mga bata, kayong mga Lumad natives, itong matatanda na ito, Sison is sick. May colon cancer. Ang gastos ng Norway, sumurender na siya. Kasi naging isyu sa pulitika eh. This government who sponsored those \u2013 who provided the good offices. Matatalo sa eleksyon dahil sa issue diyan. Kasi pabalik-balik ang mga b****, kala mo mga turista. Wala namang pinag-uusapan. Pagdating dito, gusto ng ganito, gusto ng ganyan, ah l*** mo. [laughter] Huwag mong sabihin \u2018yung meaning doon sa mga bisita. Napura na ako ba. Talagang ano ako, sir. Masyadong demanding, ni hindi naman kayo nanalo ng elections ni minsan. You cannot even hang on into a barangay. And you keep on killing people, hindi lang \u2019yung mga pulis, pati \u2018yung mga civilians na ayaw magsali sa kanila. Kaya sabi ko ano \u2013 sabi ko talaga, \u201cbuang ka.\u201d And sinabi ko talaga. Pardon pa si\u2026. Pi****** i** ko talaga siya the other day sa Davao. Sinong tinatakot ninyo? Katanda-tanda na ninyo eh. At lahat tayo mamatay. Kayong mga naiwan diyan sa kalsada, mabuti pa umuwi kayo. Wala kayong makuha diyan sa komunista. [applause] Do you think that if the ISIS prevails in this country that you will have a place in their society? You must be awfully stupid, as stupid. [applause] Wala kayong makuha. Lahat tayo damay. Thank you for allowing the exhaust dito. In our sustained effort to achieve just and lasting peace [laughter and applause]\u2026 Class, be courteous. Do not make a noise. The visitors are listening. [laughter] Just and lasting peace for a [unified] nation, we are pursuing an inclusive peace process, promoting the participation of all stakeholders, including those conflict-affected areas. We took steps to promote inclusiveness in the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) by expanding its membership through Executive Order Number 8 which I signed in November last year. By giving representation to indigenous peoples, women, children, and sultanates, and key stakeholders in the drafting of the Bangsa[moro] Basic Law, we ensure a Bangsamoro government that truly reflects the aspirations of our Muslim brothers and sisters as well as our indigenous brethren. [applause] We have embarked on various initiatives to advance our national interest in the global community. We pursue good relations with all nations anchored on an independent \u2013 on an independent foreign policy [applause] \u2013 and the basic tenets of sovereign equality, mutual respect and non-interference. [applause] As an independent nation, we will uphold and promote our national interests in the international community. We will strengthen and seek partnership with those who share our values. We will engage nations with full respect for the rule of law, sovereign equality, and again, non-interference. These are the principles that we are upholding as we advance to this year for the meeting as the Chair of the ASEAN. We have cultivated warmer relations with China through bilateral dialogues and other mechanisms, leading to easing of tensions between the two countries and improved negotiating environment on the West Philippine Sea. At this point, allow me to take a step back in time, in 1901. In 1901, there was known as Balangiga, and that is Eastern Samar. It was the time for Philippine-American War. A combined group of Filipino villagers and guerrillas, in an effort to defend Samar Island from the alien invaders, attacked and overwhelmed a US \u2013 a United States infantry garrison. Forty-eight American officers and men were slain in the attack. On the Filipino side, the casualty count was twenty-eight killed and twenty-two wounded. In retaliation, US gunboats and patrols were sent to Balangiga, Samar with the order to \u201c\u2026make a desert of Balangiga\u201d and to reduce Samar Island into an island of \u201chowling wilderness,\u201d where every male citizen from the age of ten and above, and capable of bearing arms, would be put to death. The Church bells of Balangiga were seized by the Americans as spoils of war. Those bells are reminders of the gallantry and heroism of our forebears who resisted the American colonizers and sacrificed their lives in the process. Krag against bolo \u2013 krag was the standard rifle issued to the American troops. And that is how the historians describe. [Nauna ka, pababa mo. Hindi, baba mo, tumataas \u2019yan.] [laughter] Mahirap talag kung director ka, ikaw pa ang speech. [laughter] Many historians describe \u2013 [sige] the Philippine-American war. That is why I say today; give us back those Balangiga bells. [applause] They are ours. They belong to the Philippines. [applause] They are part of our national heritage. [applause] Isauli naman ninyo. Masakit \u2019yun sa amin. We now talk about our Overseas Filipinos. They are our heroes. They and their families have sacrificed much to the \u2013 for the country. We all know how a large part of our economic \u2013 economy comes from their remittances. That is why to ensure that their rights are protected, I ordered the increase of our assistance to the OFW from 400 million pesos to more than 1 billion. [applause] We have been hard at work in securing the rights and welfare of our OFWs. A year ago, I also warned government officials and employees that I will never tolerate corruption in my administration, not even a whiff of it. Let the dismissal of several high-ranking officials \u2013 whom I myself appointed \u2013 serve as a warning to all that I will never back down on my commitment to cleanse this government and corporation. [applause] In order to bring government services closer to the people, we established hotlines [and] government centers that receive public concerns, one of which is the Hotline 911, which allowed us to receive and immediately respond to emergencies. We also launched Hot \u2013 launched Hotline 8888, the Citizen\u2019s Complaint Hotline. This is a public hotline facility that receives feedbacks or concerns on government services. Since we launched this hotline, we have received numerous complaints from the public on government \u2013 slow government processing, unclear or changing procedures and requirements, centralized issuances of clearances and permits in Metro Manila and discourteous government employees, among others. Time and again, iyong pag-transact ng ordinary...no, no the ordinary people who transact business in government. In the last ASEAN Ministerial conference, I don\u2019t know why Malacanan has to \u2013 my office has to do some work for \u2013 or the orders like itong mga barong. It\u2019s always the \u2013 that outfit takes care of the attire that will be given to the ministerial, this time to the heads of state. Alam mo, I\u2019d like to address this myself to government. Iyan bang bayaran, pabalik-balikin ninyo ang tao. I know that, because I\u2019ve been Mayor for 23 years; I never allowed it in my city. But dito, alam mo iyang mga sastre, diyan sa Paranaque haggang Cavite, iyong mga tailoring diyan, ang negosyo ang niyan in bulk - Boy Scout, teacher\u2019s uniform, Girl Scouts - naghahabol iyan sila ng mga kontrata. And they are just the stores that you find along the way until Cavite. They grouped together during times of ganito, may ASEAN and they look for a person to represent them. This is not\u2014no offense intended, but you see they look for beautiful women, the young, who would do the talking, arrangement, you know, because it\u2019s the\u2014well, it\u2019s the reality of life and the beautiful women get\u2019s the attention always. Tapos, pag na-deliver na nila, nasukatan na, pabalik-balikin ninyo and right there in Malacanan, it happened. So I will fire the lady, whoever was connected with her. As I have fired anybody else... a Cabinet member for buying an 18 million truck in Austria. That was not our contract, it was contract of the previous administration, 14 of those 18 million were already delivered. This Cabinet member was \u2013I was informed about and I said, the legal \u2013his legal office, to stop it. You know what? He went just right ahead, travel there, signed something for the... another tranche of delivery. So right there, right in the Cabinet meeting I said, \u2018were you able to read the opinion of your law, your own law office?\u2019 He said no. But Sonny Dominguez was already passing to me the \u2013 iyong sa iPhone. So I was reading it, while I was talking to him. Sabi ko P***I** mo, you are fired, you are lying. And so I fired him. Go out of this office. I don\u2019t want to see your face again. Ganoon ako ka istrikto. So iyong... the Cabinet members, they are here, they are only given noon, one year, two years, one month. The directors, makinig kayo sa gobyerno, bantay kayo. Directors, you are only given 15 days and I do not want Directors out of their office, you eat your lunch there, lahat kayong taga-gobyerno. So that you can resume to work immediately. [applause] Now ito ang deal ko sa public. There is the 8888, I cannot stop corruption and wrongdoings if you do not cooperate. You text me. Libre iyan, 8888. You name the public official. Name his sins in that bulletin and I will take it from there. Do not be afraid about libel, I will take care of that.[applause]Iyon ang gawin ninyo. I have to have your help. Hindi kasi kayo mag-ano, wala eh. Lahat, police, military, lahat pati ako. If you think that some of\u2014may nagawa ako na masama, di sabihin ninyo, do not be afraid. We are all workers of government! Kayo iyong employer namin. We get the money from your pocket to our pockets. Since when have you heard me talk about government and officials? I always address everybody \u2018workers of government.\u2019 I seldom mention Malacanan Palace, it is not a Palace, it is just a house of wood. So why should I call it the Palace. Give me something like the European style. Kaya ako I just called it office, Palace-Palace ka diyan eh. And besides, all the rats of Pasig are there.[Laughter]It\u2019s just beside Pasig River. So, iyong lahat ng mga daga diyan kung saan-saan, doon nagla-landing eh, it has a wide field. And they are not killed because they are presidential mouse.[Laughter]Iyon ang sabi ng...sundalo. Sir, hindi daw ipagbaril, ke presidential mouse, P***I** mabuti pa ang mouse dito, hindi pa pinapatay, iyong tao kinakatay ninyo. The people\u2019s patience is wearing thin. So is mine. I am reiterating my directive to all government agencies from frontline services to our people from womb to tomb -- to further streamline their respective services to make these truly efficient, and people-friendly. We want to ensure that our people receive the quality services that they deserve, minus the delays caused by bureaucratic red tape.I expect speedy reforms along this line. We will right size the national government. Let us trim the excess fat and add more muscle through the expeditious passage of \u201cThe Act Rightsizing the National Government to Improve Public Service Delivery and for other Purposes.\u201d I therefore urge Congress to pass this at the soonest. For the Government Owned and Controlled Corporations, isa pa kayo. The implementation of the existing Salary Standardization Law pending the review in the Compensation and Position Classification System, it\u2019s excessive, extravagant, and unconscionable. Salaries and allowances, incentives, benefits and bonuses across the Government Owned and Controlled Corporations at this time increases will have to pass by my office; and I am not inclined to increase your allowances, bonuses and salaries at this time.[Applause]Wala na.You cannot do it on your own. You have to direct it to the Executive Secretary and I will just tell you, I am not inclined to give increases right now. Maybe seven years from now, when Drilon makes it to the presidency. I also appeal to the Supreme Court to seriously consider the national interest and our development goals before issuing TROs and injunctions on critical government projects and cases involving government assets. I am just a co-worker also, ladies and gentlemen. May I be allowed to be also, just as frank. Tutal wala naman akong ina-ano eh... I do not need to offend you, but I cite, for example, the Supreme Court TRO that prevents the Department of Health from distributing subdermal implants, which will cause the wastage of P350 million worth of taxpayers\u2019 money. I also note that since its issuance two years ago, this TRO has impaired the government\u2019s ability to fully implement responsibly family planning and methods and the RH Law. It is time that we put an end to the practice of some parties of resorting technicalities in our laws, prevent the government from fulfilling its mandate. Ganito iyan, Ma\u2019am, eh. Tutal, this as good as any other time to talk to you and may I be understood by you. I am sorry to say this. Really I am, I do not intend to do it. But if you have to talk about government and our sins, which I am not an exception or are...you know delays, lahat naman tayo nagkakamali. Ganito iyan, two things, wala na talaga akong panahon. I don\u2019t know if I can make another SONA again in the future. It\u2019s not for me to tell that. Itong TRO has been the bane of projects and even Consunji, iyong mga Ayala nag-aaway iyan. Just to make you understand na hindi lang kayo. Tapos iyang TRO na iyan, would delay the projects. Now God... and I am asking Congress find me a law na kung may bidding naman at it was regular, dapat ang korte or somebody else should not be messing it up because it will delay the projects which has been the case in the provinces. Alam mo mag-file iyan ng kaso, either it is really the truth, well the COA will found out or makahati siya. I will withdraw the case and dissolve the TRO of course, then you just give me a few...sabihin mo 10%. Ganoon ang ugali ng Pilipino. Kaya iyang TRO na iyan is the bane of our efficiency. And I really do not know whether\u2014I will not attribute anything, Ma\u2019am, sa Supreme Court. Maybe I am at fault, so I am sorry, if I misquote or I did not have the complete facts. But itong Congress na ito passed the Reproduction Law. It was already a law na dapat i-implement, because we are really going into a family planning. I am not for abortion; I am not for birth control. But certainly, I am for the giving of the freedom to a Filipino family the size ng pamilya niya.[Applause]How many children would they be able to support and send to school? Ang nangyari nitong TRO mo, sir/ma\u2019am, may na nag-file doon sa inyo, Supreme Court, tapos nag-issue kayo ng TRO two years ago. In the meantime iyong \u2013 ang gobyerno nagbili ng medisina itong \u2018Subdermal\u2019 pati itong mga pills worth 360. It was not really a reckless purchase; it was in preparation for the implementation of the law because hindi naman akalain na mag-TRO \u2013 and it has been two years, the medicines will expire next month. I told Ubial \u2013 the Health Secretary - to find out if there is a nation, a law which would allow it and i-donate na lang rather than go to waste. Iyan ho ang nangyari. I do not blame you, you might have been very busy or something. Wala\u2014ako I\u2019m just\u2014I am below you actually. Pero sinasabi ko lang\u2014may isa pa. Huwag na lang itong speech, walang makuha diyan. The bane isa pa \u2013 itong\u2026the Congress and tayo sa gobyerno including the judges and justices, should understand that by this time, iyong lowest bid iyon ang nagpo-promote ng graft and corruption sa ating bayan.[applause] COA, you are here at malaman na lang ninyo na may violation ako. Doon sa military I do not allow them to bid but just to buy the weapons from everywhere. Because almost all countries are making arms, the tawag nila \u2013 small arms industry. We are just fighting a rebellion. True, we do not need the armaments, but diyan sa Marawi you have to hit hard because they are pre-positioned inside buildings. And until now we cannot proceed fast because there are 300 hostages. Sabi ko, Do not assault. If necessary we\u2019ll just have to wait, wait it out but we have to give food. You do not go. I don\u2019t care if they are Moro or Christian, it\u2019s not\u2014we do not have that luxury. Kasi kapag\u2014there\u2019s a distinct possibility that we are there, they will just behead everybody. So find out a way to do it, if you cannot find a way to do it then just I just said, \u201cWait it out,\u201d iyan na ang nakatagal. Baka sabihin hindi marunong itong sundalo. Ako iyong pipigil. Initially, sabi ko ang bomba eh. \u201cSir, hindi talaga madala sir. Every window is occupied iyong high rise sir.\u201d And we were losing because of the snipers. And they are in a hurry, I said, \u201cslow down.\u201d When I was\u2014hindi ako nagyayabang, when I was in the camp sa Ranao, well, I was briefing\u2014I was being briefed by the military and I was giving the instructions. I heard about 16 pumutok at saka iyong bala na weng, weng, weng. Iyong mga reporter nandoon sa likod ng stage kasi semento iyon eh. We will\u2014is this is the way how it should wait, then I will wait. Unless you can find a solution, somebody here who has the good, even a horse sense to negotiate for the release of\u2014 Iyang itong isang\u2014ibalik ko iyong lowest bid. \u201cAlam mo ang ganda niyan adre ha.\u201d Ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid iyong walang pera. Ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid sasabihin niya doon sa\u2026 \u201cMagbibigay po ako sa inyo,\u201d kung sino-sino iyan mga official. So, lowest bid papanaluhin siya. So with no capital magbibigay siya ng pera tapos bibigay\u2014lahat bigyan niya, connected who will...lahat. Pagkatapos niyan if it\u2019s 100 million projects, he has to pay so many guys, ang naiwan niya 100... out of the 100, 40 million na lang, so that is the cost of the project.So when I was campaigning for the presidency, I was all over the Philippines. My God, I could see a \u2013the appropriation, pero ang Airport nila 3 meters long, so ginawa na lang basketball court.[Laughter]And there is a province here, hindi kayo. Not you. If you look into the records back in time na puro na complex ang roads diyan, talagang daan dito, daan doon pero pagpumunta ka isang daan lang. It\u2019s only one highway, that is how corruption destroys the nation.Ngayon, last. I have to say this, kailangan ko siyang sabihin sir eh. I was elected June 30, nag-oath ako sa \u2013 July nagpunta na ako sa Davao \u2013sa AFP Medical Center. Nakuwento ko na po ito sa inyo? Hindi pa? Tapos sabi ko, \u201cI\u2019m quite familiar, kasi I signed a lot of \u2013noong mayor ako eh. Sabi ko, \u201cMay MRI ba kayo?\u201d sabi ko\u2014sabi niya, \u201cWala sir.\u201d Sabi ko, \u201cMay state of the art ba kayo na X-ray?\u201d Sabi niya, \u201cWala sir.\u201d Sabi ko, may hyperbaric ba kayo?\u201d That\u2019s the chamber where you are placed inside iyong if suffer the bends, iyong \u2013you are the\u2026nagdi-deep dive ka. But it is also high pressure that can arrest gangrene, especially those who are extracted from the field of battle about two days na, gangrene sets in. So they are placed there and it can work miracles for our wounded soldier. So in one upuan, one setting, you did this\u2026then I saw the building and I went inside, iyong drainage nila bumabalik. So I said...you know I\u2019m really surprised. You know, military men\u2026 would you allow that kind of thing? The dirt is going back to the\u2026 how do you expect the sailors to\u2014the soldiers to get well? Tapos that\u2019s the only building, the oldest. I said okay you rehabilitate it, I\u2019ll give you a new one, in the meantime. But about last month, I went to the back of my office, doon sa barracks ng Presidential Guards. So there were groundbreaking for the hospitals of the soldiers, and I asked the soldiers who were there also from V. Luna, \u201cAre you now using the equipments?\u201d Alam mo ang sinagot sa akin? \u201cSir, tayo-tayo na lang mag-usap. Huwag na lang \u2018yan sila.\u201d T***ina, wala\u2026 hindi pa na-deliver. Sinabi ko, if this is the way how you treat our soldiers and they are dying now, and that machine was ordered a year ago, then a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, a mutiny is not a surprise to me. Kaya sabi ko kay Ubial, hindi niya kasalanan\u2026 it\u2019s because of the procurement, pero ganoon kahaba. Is Secretary Ubial here? Are you here, Secretary? Change the procedure because I will change you.[Laughter/Applause]Talagang mag-coup d\u2019\u00e9tat ito\u2026 Marami nang\u2014we are losing about, by this time\u2026 every day we lose about... ten? Sometimes I say it\u2019s a useless war here, but there is a rebellion. Sabi ko maski kung ako ang sundalo ninyo, and there is a machine already ordered, it could have saved my life, tapos wala Ma\u2019am\u2026 eh p***ina, mag- coup d\u2019\u00e9tat ako and let us get the machine by ourselves. I will not be surprised if it\u2019s already in their mind. Ako, I\u2019m be too willing to step down. But as a long term solution, I urge Congress to thoroughly review the existing procurement laws, and come up with legislation that will ensure prompt delivery of goods and services to the people \u2013 especially medicines and hospital equipments. Kasi itong military, ay sabi ko do not mind COA, I will answer for that. Since COA is here, I limited to three places where military can buy the equipments because I am sure that they will work and they can kill the enemies and make even our forces stronger or in parity with what they have in on the other side. Itong armas, sabi ko, \u2018wag mong sundin iyang ano. I will explain to COA why. \u2018Wag mo akong papabilhin diyan sa mga lugar nang...gawa ng South America at lahat diyan sa mid-European. Eastern European countries are also\u2014there are good ones, but I limited them to...especially, equipments in listening. Kasi kung magbili ka doon sa iba nakikinig rin sila, sabay na kayo. Tatlo na kayong nagko-communicate. Tawag sa Bisaya \u201cBrin!\u201d Our laws should support and not impede national development in a speedy and sustainable manner. In our bid to accelerate human capital development, we should ensure lifelong opportunities by enhancing quality of and access to education, training programs. We have sustained investments in higher education and committed to the full implementation of the K to 12 Basic Foundation Program. We have widened the reach of skills training and increased the number of out-of-school children and youth who have availed of the Alternative Learning System. To ensure that Filipinos are given equitable access to quality and affordable health services, we expanded health insurance coverage and benefits. The destitute and the indigents, or those who just could not afford hospitalization, can now be provided with free services of government-operated and public hospitals as well. We have strengthened the implementation of the No Balance Billing Policy.[Applause] Kayong mga Pilipino nakikinig sa akin ngayon. Magpa-hospital kayo, ako ang magbayad, tutal hindi man nila ako mademanda. Pasok lang kayo doon, occupy the hospital, sabihin mo lang... totoo. Pasok kayo ng hospital, sabihin ninyo na sabi ni Mayor Duterte, pagamot daw kami, siya daw ang bahala magbayad. Marami tayong tresurero dito, ilan oh. Huwag na iyan, iyong iba naman. Sa taas na. I have signed Executive Order No. 26 imposing a ban on smoking in public places to mitigate its consequences. We want tominimize access to tobacco products, and provide a more supportive environment for those who are attempting to quit tobacco use. Alam mo bakit, tinamaan ako ng... hindi ba ito. I\u2019ve been very frankly. I have a Barrett and I have a Buergers disease caused by smoking. So, ang problema niyan in a survey in the Philippines, all over the world. Why is it that the women force... workforce in an office and the men have acquired an equal, almost in parity in numbers, sick of cancer. It was found out, because if the poor girl has also to inhale your smoke, kaya iyan inumpisahan ko sa Davao. In Davao, you cannot see a person there walking with a cigarette. Foreigners, they are very... they can argue with you, they says my money, not your money. Well then okay, eat your money or I will shoot your balls. Investing in the health sector is never a cost to be endured but an opportunity to be explored. If we have to embrace the vision of a prosperous Philippines, we have to start putting value to our people\u2019s well-being \u2013 because the success of every Filipino\u2019s pursuit to life, liberty and happiness directly mirrors the fulfilment of our aspirations as a Filipino. I would like to reiterate my personal and this administration\u2019s commitment to fully implement the Magna Carta of Women to the barangay level tapos na ito. To this effect, an executive order will be issued to local government units institutionalizing gender and development programs and services. We are targeting to increase Government spending on infrastructure from 5 percent of the GDP in 2017 to 7 percent of the GDP by 2022, amounting to a total of 8 to 9 trillion pesos or 160 to 180 billion dollars.[Applause] Infrastructure projects. We will make the next few years the \u201cGolden Age of Infrastructure\u201d in the Philippines to enhance our mobility and connectivity, and thereby spur development growth equitable in the country. In other words, we are going to Build, Build and Build. To improve our sea connectivity, we launched 15 brand new RORO vessels to ply major nautical routes all over the country. We also opened an ASEAN Ro-Ro Shipping Route connecting the ports of Davao and General Santos, Philippines to Bitung, Indonesia. To address the congestion of our sea ports, we modernized the Ports of Iloilo, General Santos, Cagayan de Oro and Zamboanga.We shall complete strategic road and bridge projects and some of the road sections shall be widened and improved to address the worsening traffic. Alam mo, si Ma\u2019am Grace... You are pushing for \u2013 you know, when I became President, EDSA was already horrendous as it was a horror of the other administrations. Now, I brought in Tugade, because Tugade is to me, a bright boy. He is a billionaire; he was my classmate, ewan ko nandito siya. He was our valedictorian in the law class, talagang mahusay. But we needed money and we tried to get your help to raise money. Eh ayaw naman ninyong ibigay, di hanggang ngayon, 'andiyan pa iyong EDSA. Okay lang, at least gumanda ang lahat. Mag-iwan naman tayo ng pangit. We will not make it all smooth in the Philippines, we leave a little alley known as EDSA as the road to perdition. But anyway, since, I could not get any funding, I traveled to China and make friends with them. And the Ambassador, Ambassador Zhao. Thank you for the help. And as a matter of fact,[Applause]they are willing. They said if your Congress has no money, we will give you the money and China has committed to build two bridges to span Pasig River free of charge.[Applause]So that you will be comfortable in crossing Pasig. Well anyway, all of these strategic road and transport projects shall go to naught if we cannot free our streets, which continue to be obstructed by illegally parked vehicles. Iyong EDSA na iyan, traffic obstructions and undisciplined drivers who stop in the middle of the road, and unsanctioned barriers in some areas. I am directing the MMDA and the LGUs of Metro Manila, as well as the LGUs of Metro Cebu and all our regional centers to ensure the free flow of traffic, and immediately clear our roads and thoroughfares of all unnecessary obstruction, including vehicles parked on the streets/barriers.[Applause]Sanctioned by the government, and penalize all traffic obstructionists regardless of stature \u2013 sometimes, hindi mo maano diyan, because the police, it\u2019s a Cabinet member. Pero me, I have not authorized my Cabinet member to utilize the low plate. It\u2019s not for us to...you just use an ordinary plate. Para walang masabi iyong tao. And I do not want you parking there, when there\u2019s no parking. Please we move \u2013 Airports. We are building new airports. We might get some money also from China and we\u2019ll have new airports in the coming days and we are now accelerating the implementation of the communications, navigations, surveillance and air traffic managements system projects which will result the on-time arrivals, departures better managed air traffic, reduced flight operational cost and safer and more convenient travel experience. Revenues are the life blood of government which enables us to provide for the people\u2019s needs. Last May 31, 2017, we achieved the first step towards more equitable taxes to fund better services for the people. I commend the House of Representatives for heeding my urgent certification of the tax reform by passing the first of five packages of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program with an overwhelming 246 votes, representing almost 9 percent of the Filipino people. The fate of the tax reform is now in the hands of the Senate. Ano ba ang gusto ninyong gawin, magluhod ako diyan? Well really, I leave it up to you. We are all Filipinos. If you think that\u2019s a waste, fine! If you think, it\u2019s not good, it\u2019s okay with me. I can survive. I call on the Senate so support my tax reform in full and to pass it without haste.[Applause] Ayaw man mag pakpak, pati is ano, wala. They are not clapping. Si Angara, ayaw ring mag-clap.[Laughter]Bantay ka lang sa eleksyon, tingnan mo.[Laughter] These reforms are designed to be pro-poor, especially when the people understand how the revenues will be spent. The passage of the Tax Reform Law is needed to fund the proposed 2018 budget which I am submitting here and today. The poor and vulnerable are at the heart of my tax reform. Your support would ensure that the benefits of the tax reform can be felt immediately by them. In the meantime, the DOF and BIR are strengthening and running after tax evaders.[Applause] I have directed the DOF and the BIR to accept Mighty Corporation\u2019s offer of P25 billion to settle its tax liabilities. After the settlement, Mighty will no longer engage in the tobacco business. This will be the biggest tax settlement on record. It will produce a windfall for government, which is significant since we have face the unexpected costs of rebuilding Marawi and Ormoc. The acceptance of the tax settlement offer does not preclude other criminal charges against the company that the BIR may decide to file. A settlement will allow government to avoid a long court battle that, as we saw in previous cases, could take years to resolve. Let this be a lesson to others. This administration will spare no one found cheating the government of its due. We view Information and Communications Technology or ICT as an effective medium to implement positive and meaningful changes in our society. To this end, my Cabinet approved the National Broadband Plan of 2017 to begin the work of bringing affordable internet access to every community and improving broadband connectivity in the country. We have also installed free WiFi internet in almost 400 public places around the country. We hope that the public...[Applause]will use them to access important information and services. The National Government Portal, which we launched recently, will allow faster and easier delivery of public services and reduce the number of visits of the public to agencies for government transactions. The Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting Migration Plan has also been launched. The switch to digital from analog transmission will not only give a better TV viewing experience but also provide effective and reliable information to Filipinos in times of calamities. The government-owned Salaam Digital TV, the first Muslim TV in the Philippines, is now already on test broadcasting. These are some of the things that we have done for the past twelve months. A more detailed narrative is contained in my \u2018Report to the People,\u2019 will be released soon.Whether or not my first year of administration was a year of gains or a year of setbacks is not for me to say but for the people to judge; I defer to the people\u2019s judgment. My fellow citizens...[Applause]much remains to be done. Corruption persists like a fishbone stuck in the throat; it pains and it is disconcerting. We need to pry corruption from government corpus which is deeply embedded and we also need to put an end to squabbles and bickerings with an agencies focused truly on speedy provision of quality public services to our people. Believe me, it is easier to build from scratch than to dismantle the rotten and rebuild upon its rubbles. Nevertheless, let us work together and lay a new foundation upon which a better Philippines can be reconstructed. Help me build a better tomorrow. Let me end \u2013 gusto ninyo uwi na tayo? Oh buksan ninyo pinto, malapit na ang pinto sa inyo. Let me end by wishing everyone in the language of the old: \u201cMay God Keep us forever sheltered in the hollow of His hand.\u201d Salamat.  \u2013 Rappler.com"}, "https://www.rappler.com/nation/full-text-duterte-sona-speech-2020": {"Title": "FULL TEXT: President Duterte\u2019s State of the Nation Address 2020", "Release Date": "JUL 27, 2020 7:16 PM PHT", "Extract Date": "November 29, 2020 17:30:00", "Transcript": "Jul 27, 2020 7:16 PM PHT MANILA, Philippines \u2013 President Rodrigo Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday afternoon, July 27, against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.  In the middle of his speech, the health department announced 1,657 new coronavirus cases, bringing the country's total to 82,040 cases.  The speech lasted for around 1 hour and 40 minutes. Below is the full text of Duterte's SONA for 2020, as provided by Malaca\u00f1ang. Kindly\u2026 Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; former Presidents Joseph Ejercito Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo; Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta and the justices of the Supreme Court; His Excellency Munther Mafoodh Salim Al-Mantheri and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; mga mahal kong kababayan. We live in a troubled time. Our dream of prosperity for our country was suddenly snuffed by a pandemic virulent virus. No nation was spared. Neither rich nor poor were exempt from the onslaught of this deadly disease. But let us not despair. The vaccine is around the corner. Sooner and not later, the virus that gobbled up thousands of lives will itself be laid to rest. In the meantime, let us express the nation\u2019s gratitude to those who courageously and willingly put their lives on the line to serve the people and country. We share the griefs of their families and no amount of tears can compensate their great losses. My countrymen, it is sad that while government focuses its attention and resources to battle the coronavirus, there are those who take advantage of a pre-occupied government. One of them is Senator Frank Drilon. In an interview, he arrogantly mentioned among others that oligarchs need not be rich. Then he linked the anti-dynasty system with oligarchy and the topic was my daughter and son. This happened after the Committee on Franchise voted 70-11 to deny the grant of franchise to ABS-CBN. Obviously, he was defending the Lopezes that they are not oligarchs. Great wealth enables economic elites and corporations to influence public policy to their advantage. Media is a powerful tool in the hands of oligarchs like the Lopezes who used their media outlets in their battles with political figures. I am a casualty of the Lopezes during the 2016 election. The dealers and purveyors of illegal drugs, hiding in the shadow of COVID-19, have stepped up their activities. The amount of shabu valued at millions of pesos seized during police operations speak volumes of the enormity and weight of the problem that we bear. The corrupt, the grafters and the influence peddlers also take advantage of the fear and confusion that the coronavirus generates. The financial and material assistance of the government to the unemployed, the sick and the destitute running into billions of pesos, are not spared from corruption and ineptitude. Even the donations from well-meaning private persons are skimmed before reaching their intended beneficiaries. It is like snatching food from the mouths of babes. The profiteers, over-pricers and corrupt felons must be laughing while they stash their dirty monies. But not for long. They cannot outrun the long arm of the law. In this regard, the words of former President Ramon Magsaysay ring fresh and relevant today as on the day they were said decades ago. He said: \u201cWe need men of integrity and faith like Rizal and del Pilar, men of action like Bonifacio, men of inflexible patriotism like Mabini. We need their zeal, their self-reliance, their capacity for work, their devotion to service, their ability to lose themselves in the common cause of building a nation.\u201d If we allow greed, self-interest and ambition to rule us, then as stated by one prominent physician, we will \u201cbe left with nothing better than the lesser evil instead of the greater good.\u201d In my inaugural address four years ago, I said that no leader can succeed at anything of national importance [or] significance unless he has the cooperation and support of the people he is tasked to lead and sworn to serve. The efforts and resources which we poured out produced the momentum needed to bring our country closer to our goals. Suffice it to state, we made significant strides over time. Over 4.3 million poor families benefitted from the Pantawid Pamilya; over 9.2 million beneficiaries received subsidies under the Unconditional Cash Transfer program; we also made available [free] tertiary education and universal health care. Public utility drivers were given assistance through the Pantawid Pasada Program. There are complaints that some drivers did not receive any assistance at all. I have directed the DSWD and DILG to look into this. I welcome the passage of the law postponing the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections. The postponement saved much-needed government funds and ensured implementation of projects under the current barangay officials. In hindsight, it also saved us from holding the polls while we dealt and continue to deal with the pandemic. The Malasakit Centers Act has proven to be of great help to our less fortunate citizens needing medical services through a one-stop platform in government hospitals. We commend the initiative and work of Senator Bong Go in this regard as well as other significant pieces of legislation. As of today, there are 75 Malasakit Centers serving Filipinos all over the country. These centers will be of great help in ensuring that our people remain healthy and resilient during these challenging times. The Salary Standardization Law of 2019 increases the salary of civilian government workers. I hope that this law will inspire our government workers to perform better and encourage young, brilliant citizens to join public service. I appreciate the law establishing the National Academy of Sports. We can now give our deserving student-athletes the training and support they need to excel in their chosen field of endeavors. With the commitment of key members of Congress and the Executive Department, the PHISGOC, Philippine Sports Commission, and the Philippine Olympic Committee were bound together with one vision to host the 30th Southeast Asian Games. Our athletes prevailed. More than that, we fostered pride, patriotism, genuine sportsmanship, and camaraderie in our South East Asian brothers and sisters. Indeed, we won as one. To our business community and the general public, we assure you that the landmark Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act has been gaining momentum. We are closer to eliminating overregulation in government services. Frontline processes, including consular services, processing of building and business permits, and services for overseas Filipinos and seafarers were streamlined. Passports and drivers\u2019 license validity were lengthened to ease the burden of the public. We received a BBB plus credit rating despite a sea of credit rating downgrades and negative outlook revisions worldwide. [applause] The Japan Credit Rating Agency upgraded us from BBB plus to A minus last month. Meanwhile, Moody\u2019s has affirmed and maintained the country\u2019s ratings at B2 --- Baa2 rather. [Understand. Because of the light I have \u2026 My eyesight is not as good as new.] Our fiscal position is strong, our economic and fiscal management prudent and our banking system robust. We are in a better position to weather the crisis caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic. We have accomplished significant infrastructure projects under the Build Build Build Program.  I will not dwell lengthily on the nitty-gritty of our infrastructure accomplishments now lest I bore you. Instead we will release a comprehensive written report on our collective milestones and the details of accomplishments to remind us that perseverance, patience and determination will help us move forward even in the most difficult of times. We issued last year Executive Order No. 100 establishing the Diversity and Inclusion Program as a national program of the Government. We want to end the discrimination of persons on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, and other character traits. My administration always believed that freedom from illegal drugs, terrorism, corruption and criminality, is itself a [human right]. Part of our efforts to uphold human rights is protection of the rights of children and the right against discrimination. Early last year, I signed Executive Order No. 92 creating the National Council Against Child Labor. Government efforts to protect the rights of children will be amplified to prevent, reduce and eliminate any form of child labor. Our achievements along these lines have been extolled by an overwhelming number of our fellow member-States in the UN Human Rights Council, during its recently held 44th session last June. Rest assured that we will not dodge our obligation to fight for human rights.  My countrymen, there are lessons to be learned from the coronavirus pandemic. It jolted us to realize that gains made after spending so much planning, effort, cost and time could diminish considerably and quickly for reasons beyond one\u2019s anticipation; that it is much easier to destroy than to build; that in a crisis of national proportions that affects every aspect of human life, governments need to have the support and cooperation of the people if it is to succeed in battling the cause of that crisis, that there are people who ask for compassion but show none themselves; that life, after all, is fickle like the weather. The gains we achieved in the first three and a half years were put to a test when the pandemic suddenly struck the global community. While I am aware that the road towards a comfortable life for all would be far easy if pandemic had not occurred and along the rest of the world we suffered. The global scale and socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented. Yet in the throes of this global health emergency, we have been able to withstand the headwinds generated by this coronavirus. In this regard I would like to express my gratitude to all those who made possible the steady supply of food, water, and basic utilities [to] our households [applause] and the provision of basic social services and financial assistance to our people. Our profound gratitude goes to everyone who helped keep our country\u2019s food supply chain running, the valiant soldiers, policemen and security guards who kept peace and order [applause] in our communities; the dedicated personnel who kept our essential establishments operational. You showed us kindness and selflessness. You gave us strength. You risked your own lives to serve the greater good in keeping with the Filipino spirit of Bayanihan. [applause] I also thank the men and women of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases and the National Task Force against COVID-19 for all the countless hours it spent to keep the pandemic in check and for all the efforts it made to ensure the safety of our people. [applause] Let me also recognize the efforts of the local government units that stepped up and initiated their own response measures to contain the effects of COVID-19 and its impact to their constituents. Have been --- impact to its constituents. [The shadow says it\u2019s a period there.] I know exactly the difficulties you are undergoing. I pray that the officials of each LGU in our country \u2013 from the barangay to the autonomous regions \u2013 would set aside partisan politics and selfish interests to do what is right and good for all. [applause] I likewise issued Executive Order No. 104, which imposed ceilings on the retail prices of at least 133 drugs and medicines, and directed a continuous review of the retail prices of others. This proved to be providential now that we are facing a pandemic. To everyone who helped us in this time of great need, maraming salamat po. [applause] Let me say that the strength of a nation rests in the hands of the people acting as one with government, in the pursuit of common goals and objectives. When the pandemic struck, I decided to prioritize life over other considerations. According to experts, the interventions that the government had put in place prevented as much as 1.3 to 3.5 million infections. To me, even if the numbers were much lower, it would still be and would have been worth the sacrifice[s] we made. \u201cBuhay muna, bago ang lahat.\u201d [applause] We initially encountered difficulties ramping up our testing capacity. We now have 93 accredited testing laboratories nationwide and we are aiming to conduct 1.4 million tests by end of July and ensure a quick turnaround time of 48 to 72 hours.  Under the Social Amelioration Program, we allotted [PhP205 billion] for poor and low-income households who were affected during this pandemic --- who thrive on a \u201cno-work, no-pay\u201d arrangement. Admittedly, our implementation of the Social Amelioration Program was not perfect. And some opportunists turned crisis into opportunity. We will catch up with you sooner than you think. We came up with the COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program. We extended financial assistance to over 650,000 affected individuals in the formal sector, 110,000 OFWs abroad, and almost 83,000 repatriated OFWs. We also provided temporary wage employment [opportunities] to displaced marginalized workers through the TUPAD Project. Our indigent senior citizens were also provided with a stipend for the [first] semester of the current year. This health emergency stretched the government\u2019s resources to its limits. In response, the Office of the President worked closely with Congress for the quick passage of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. May I again reiterate my thanks to you, the men and women of Congress, for the effort you invested into passing that law. I hope that we can get some or the same treatment of clarity, purpose and the fastness [applause] to support the passage of the Bayanihan [to Recover as One Act], which will supplement funds for recovery and response against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must facilitate the country\u2019s economic recovery. I call on Congress to fast-track the passage of proposed measures such as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or CREATE Act. [applause] This immediately cuts the corporate income levy from the current 30 to 25 percent and give the government flexibility to grant a combination of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, among others. The Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer or FIST Act will set up mechanisms allowing banks and other financial institutions to dispose of and transfer non-performing assets and loans to asset management companies similar to Special Purpose Vehicles. Our economic managers have seen infrastructure investment as an effective tool to help spur high growth, attract investments, create jobs, and achieve financial inclusion for all Filipinos. The [DPWH] has resumed the construction of the North Luzon Expressway Harbor Link, the NLEX-SLEX Connector, the Cavite-Laguna Expressway, the Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, the R-1 Bridge Project, the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway Project, and the Subic Freeport Expressway Project, to name a few. To realize the maximum benefit from the country\u2019s investments, the infrastructure projects under the Build, Build, Build Program, which are labor and capital intensive, are not mere springboards for the country\u2019s swift recovery [post]-pandemic. They are economic benefits --- economic benefits to be distributed to all corners of the country and push sustainability in urban centers, particularly [Metro] Manila. The TESDA launched an online mode of livelihood and skills training. There are 71 free online training to help upskill trainees for the right opportunities. [opportunities, I\u2019m sorry] I ask the TESDA to come up with special training programs to retool our OFWs so they can find employment opportunities here at home. I am also calling on the CHED for scholarship programs for the qualified dependents of our OFWs. I direct the Department of Agriculture and DTI to come up with agri-business and entrepreneurship projects to help displaced OFWs rebuild their livelihood. Further, I ask the LANDBANK and other government financial institutions to continue providing low-interest loans to our OFWs. Sa mga kababayan ko na naghihirap sa ibang bansa, nandito ang inyong gobyerno para matulungan kayo at inyong mga pamilya, lalo na sa panahong ito. [applause] The government will intensify its efforts to help businesses, especially our micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs, by providing responsive government assistance and services, capitalization, and business operations support as we adapt to the next normal. [applause] Nananawagan po ako sa ating mga lessors \u2013 nananawagan po ako sa ating mga lessors: malasakit at Bayanihan po sana ang pairalin natin ngayon. This is not the time to drive away lessees. During normal times they were the primary source of your income stream. Now, it\u2019s time to be fair and compassionate. Come up with amenable arrangement with your tenants. Huwag po natin silang ipagtabuyan, tanggalan ng tubig, kuryente, at bubong. Commercial establishments are requested to give grace periods [or] allow deferment of payments, especially for MSMEs that were forced to close down during the quarantine period.  Let us help them recover. [applause] We pump-primed the recovery and rehabilitation of MSMEs. The DTI, through the Small Business Corporation, set up the PhP1-billion COVID-19 Assistance to Restart Enterprises or CARES Program to provide zero-interest loans for MSMEs affected by the pandemic. As of July 10, 2020, over 2,600 loan applications worth [PhP182.5 million] have been approved. We are optimistic that this initiative will help our MSMEs stabilize and recover from their losses. I also enjoin the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and banks operating in the country to provide regulatory relief for our MSMEs and allow loan payment extensions, without incurring penalties and charges. [applause] We need your help to prevent the collapse of companies saddled with accumulated amortizations and payables caused by the closure of their businesses at the height of the strict quarantine periods. As we embark on these efforts towards inclusive recovery, we should acknowledge that all forms of government support will go to naught if the new MSMEs do not thrive because of lack of consumer support. Ito ang panahon para suportahan natin ang ating mga kababayan [applause] na nagnenegosyo at gumagawa ng mga produktong sariling atin.  In the same manner, the tourism and recreation industries, which are among the hardest hit by the pandemic, count on our full support. While we slowly try to put the fun back in our local travels, the national government agencies and LGUs must harmonize their policies to boost tourism [while] ensuring everyone\u2019s well-being. We enjoin our people to help boost the economy by traveling locally [applause] [local na lang] once the necessary systems are in place. The DoST offers its Enterprise Technology Upgrading Program to enable businesses to access training that will help them transition to online and contactless operations. Now more than ever, we need to protect our consumers. I direct the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure the empowerment of Filipinos on their consumer rights, and coordinate strategies between public and private organizations in building a fair, safe, resilient, and sustainable economy. [applause] There are welcome developments for the e-Commerce industry. But major economic activities take place in a borderless environment with meager regulatory controls. They expose consumers to various risks related to security, data privacy, and misrepresentation. We must patrol the country\u2019s cyberspace and enforce online consumer and data protection and privacy laws. We must run after online scammers and those undermining the people\u2019s trust in online transactions. We must continue to protect Filipinos in the new normal and remind the world that we are responsible stewards of data. I am committed to protect both the physical and digital lives of our law-abiding countrymen. [applause] The national government shall lead the way in our transition to online systems. I reiterate my call for all government instrumentalities to implement systems that shall make physical queuing a thing of the past. Panahon na para mawala [applause] na ang pila para mapagsilbihan ang gobyerno nang walang kahirapan para sa tao. The DILG, DBM, and the ARTA, along with all agencies and instrumentalities of government, are hereby directed to make [all] possible services available online. We need to adjust to and adopt a paper-less type business and work performance. We need e-governance [to provide] our people with the services they need [from] the comfort of their homes or workplaces. It will enable our bureaucracy to better transition into in the 'new normal' and cut or minimize red tape. Until the COVID-19 vaccine is available, I will not allow the traditional face-to-face teaching or learning unless [all] risks of exposure to sickness are eliminated. I cannot and will not put to risk the health and lives of our students and teachers. [applause] Iyong\u2026. About two weeks ago, I --- I seemed to have said that I would allow the face-to-face classes to resume. But we were talking actually of January because my thinking is that by September, we would have the vaccine. How to get it from the producers or from other governments is really something which we have to deal with because everyone --- the\u2026 It's a global need and everyone will go for it.  But let me just mention it in passing that about four days ago, I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first or if it is needed, if we have to buy it, that we will be granted credit so that we can normalize as fast as possible. Life that is lost is lost forever. Courses that are not substantial can be supplemented. Education that is delayed can be recovered. We must implement online learning, modular learning, and TV- and radio-based broadcast, which students coming from different backgrounds can avail. DepEd will provide printed modules for those who cannot afford online learning.   In support of the Learning Continuity Program through blended learning, we plan to increase the number of schools with ICT equipment in the coming months. The DepEd and the DICT are building up the Public Education Network or PEN that will connect all public schools and DepEd offices nationwide. We will prioritize the connection of all Last Mile Schools and those with no electricity supply can have it via satellite and energized via solar panels. By 2022, before I step down, the PEN shall be realized. [applause] I\u2019m referring to the program. I will --- I will do it. TV frequencies reverted back to the government for whatever cause or reason [shall be used] exclusively to the exclusion of [private] persons or [their] dummies, to cope with the demand of the next normal. These will be used to provide uninterrupted quality education to our children in our shift to e-learning. I am directing Secretary Guevarra, Secretary Dela Pe\u00f1a and Secretary Honasan, in collaboration with Secretary Briones, and Secretary Avisado, together with Secretary Dominguez, to come up with an integrated program and implementation mechanism to ensure that these TV frequencies are fully utilized by government through the facilities of PTV4 for the utmost benefit of the Filipino people. [applause] Let me just --- allow me to segue a little bit. For the remaining two years of my term, all that is good that belongs to government, whether it be the airwaves, whether it be the lines, or whatever that is good for the people, will belong to the government and it should be government who should be given the first option to utilize them. Ang sobra, kanila. [applause] I call on our [telecommunication] companies to improve their services lest we be forced to take drastic steps to address the less-than-ideal service that the public is getting from you. Alam mo sisingit na lang ako dito. I am\u2026 Sometimes we are a government pictured to be weak and incompetent because we cannot really force our mandate. Alam mo itong nagbibigay ng mga public services, you better improve.  Huwag naman ninyo kaming pahintayin sampung taon bago kami makakamit ng mga services that the other countries are enjoying. If it's just a question of added capitalization or the infusion of money, go and look for it. Maghanap kayo because if you are not ready to improve --- anak --- I might just as well close all of you and we revert back to the line telephone at kukunin ko 'yan, i-expropriate ko sa gobyerno. Alam mo itong\u2026 I'll be straight, iyong Smart pati itong Globe, ilang taon na ito, at ang sagot palagi sa akin, \"the party cannot be reached.\" Eh nasaan pala pumunta 'yung y*** na 'yon? Eh kung ganoon lang naman ibigay ninyo sa amin, we are a republic, a sovereign country, bear that in mind because the patience of the Filipino people is reaching its limit, at I will be the one to articulate the anger of the Filipino people. And you might not want what I intend to do with you. Kindly improve the services before December. I want to call Jesus Christ to Bethlehem. Better have that line cleared. [applause] Alam mo sa totoo lang, at the end --- naa-ano na ako sa inyo. I have been a citizen of this country and parang nilalaro lang ninyo ang\u2026 Kayong may pera, p. May pera kayo? Negosyo kayo. Wala kayong pera? P, umalis kayo dito. You know, you give us half deals, half-cooked transactions, lousy service. Tapos ang tao nagbabayad.  Tell us now if you cannot really improve on it because I will work by December. I have two years. The next two years will be spent improving the telecommunications of this country without you. I will find a way. I will talk to Congress and find a way how to do it. [applause] Last year, I said that distributing economic and business activities is imperative to our country\u2019s sustained and equitable growth. Today I reiterate that statement. I issued Administrative Order No. 18, directing concerned agencies to strengthen the development of Special Economic Zones in areas outside Metro Manila. I also issued Executive Order No. 114 to institutionalize the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-Asa Program. This consolidates and refocuses existing economic and social welfare programs, activities and projects toward the countryside. It also [establishes] an [inter-agency] council, headed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, which will create a framework for the effective implementation of the project. [Kung hindi ninyo ako naiintindihan sa binabasa ko, mas lalo ako.] [laughter] In 2021, we aim to increase access to healthcare services by continuously hiring and deploying more than 20,000 health professionals. This will augment health workforce in the LGUs, particularly in isolated and disadvantaged areas. We will implement projects to establish and improve Barangay Health Stations, Rural Health Units, and other healthcare facilities. [But] we [still] need to address internal security. We are pursuing a whole-of-nation approach to bring peace and order and development in the countryside. We need to provide interventions and implement the Barangay Development Program. This would provide cleared and threatened communities and\u2026 This refers to a program where the Armed Forces would play a vital role in the one-nation approach. This is what simply --- mean by this. And that everyone, every agency of the government including the Armed Forces of the Philippines should participate. And I am aware of the skirmishes and the assassination of our soldiers and I said, \u201cCorrect this so that we can proceed with the barangay implementation as fast as possible.\u201d We have made significant strides in the past four years, but we need the support of local government leaders. We need your help to implement the Barangay Development Program. Certain sectors expressed concerns when I declared martial law in Mindanao and its extension three times. But 2019 ended without my office requesting any further extension. Martial law in Mindanao ended without abuses by the civilian sector, by the police, by the military. [applause] It ended because this time I know that they know how to love the country. I thank Congress for its support to this administration\u2019s programs. Congress has been very productive. But much more remains to be done. You know actually my speech if you followed it carefully, it\u2019s all a plea to Congress to do this, to do that, to make a law or craft a whatever. And this one, I strongly urge Congress to pass a law establishing the Department of Overseas Filipinos [focused] solely on addressing the concerns of Filipinos abroad and their families. I reiterate the swift passage --- before that --- before this\u2026 Kawawa kasi itong ating mga overseas. If it\u2019s only an office there in the Labor department they are overworked or for whatever reason, their needs, their pleas are not really attended to with dispatch and with care. OFW pati itong ano ngayon ito \u2018yung sinabi ko kanina, they --- I\u2026 I will go for it. We will need it to help them. I reiterate the swift passage of a law reviving the death penalty [applause] by lethal injection for crimes specified under the Comprehensive Dangerous [Drugs] Act of 2002. I did not hear so much clapping so I presume that [applause] they are not interested. Wala kang\u2026 Someday I\u2019ll tell you the story what happened to the Philippines. Hindi ngayon. But when I\u2019m --- sasabihin ko sa inyo ang totoo bakit nagkaganito \u2019yung droga ng Pilipinas. Why the drug syndicates continue to operate just like the countries of Colombia, Mexico, and it is being played inside the national penitentiaries. Para tayong --- talagang binababoy tayo. Sabihin ko sa inyo. But this is not a time for storytelling. SONA kasi ito so dito na lang. This law will not only help us deter criminality but also save our children from the dangers posed by illegal and dangerous drugs. May I be allowed with the indulgence of the body, itong bakit talaga ako galit sa droga. Let us make this a semi-formal speech. Alam mo kasi limang pamilya members o anim or pito, pagka bumagsak \u2018yung tatay to drugs, the family crumbles. There\u2019s no more home to them. Droga, and if he\u2019s receiving a salary naglala --- nagtatrabaho sa pantalan, 300 a day, tapos ang shabu is sold at two. He has about 100 to bring home. Kaya pagka ganun nagaaway-away na, ang mga bata hindi nakakapag-aral, \u2018yung iba ligaw na mga babae into early prostitution kung ano-ano nangyari. Hindi lang alam nitong mga --- na this is happening all over the country everyday. And what is really very tragic is this, when the family starts to crumble, there\u2019s no home, and invariably the wife would look for another\u2026 Now the husband will look for a job usually easily doon sa abroad. At \u2018yung asawa aalis, \u2018yung bana --- lalaki nasa droga, \u2018yung mga anak iniiwan sa kapitbahay, sa kapatid. And the ferocity of the laws of the Filipino family home has been destroyed. Kaya kung anong mangyari nito the wife works in the Middle East. I am not zeroing on any particular country mind you. But alam naman natin there are tribes in the Middle East which would allow rape as part of the territory of being a househelp. Kasama \u2018yan, kasama talaga \u2018yan. So iyan ang mahirap diyan. You have a wife there being crucified, being used. Magpadala ng pera tapos ang mga anak nasa shabu na rin kasi these are the guys that the shabu people would really you know they stick by them until it crumbles, the resistance. And then you have plenty of this all over the country. Hindi lang nila alam \u2018yung sinasabi nila na misery sa itong human rights, plus 10 \u2018yan. Not to count the victims of crimes perpetrated by people addicted to shabu. That is the reason why I\u2019m so vicious in my --- galit talaga ako kasi nilalaruan tayo. Well, I don\u2019t know any other president might --- pero ako ayaw ko \u2018yon. Ayaw kong lalaruan ang Pilipino. Do not do it in my country because I will really kill you. That is a commitment. Owning safe, decent and affordable housing is every Filipino\u2019s dream. But the housing market remains inaccessible to most of our countrymen. I renew my call for Congress to pass the National Housing Development bill and the Rental Housing Subsidy bill. These will enable all Filipinos\u2014regardless of social status\u2014to live in decent homes where their families can lead meaningful lives. I also call on Congress to amend Republic Act No. 10912 [or] the Continuing Professional Development Act of 2016. In this time of great pandemic and forthcoming reconstruction, requiring our professionals to undergo seminars is burdensome and not realistic. This must end. Ito pang isa, there are --- may mga profession\u2026 Isingit ko na lang lahat tutal this is to inform the nation. May mga profession na they would require --- I think it\u2019s the nurses --- they would require them to come to Manila to retrain and --- for another round of expenses. Itong mga seminar-seminar na ito dapat mahinto. I don\u2019t know in other provinces [applause] but during my time \u2018yang --- [ano \u2018tong sa barangay na?] barangay expeditions ng mga opisyal, hininto ko rin \u2018yan. Which reminds me, I will act on this also in due time. We hail our health professionals as heroes. Now is the time to pass the Advanced Nursing --- iyan ho --- Nursing Education Act and the law instituting the Medical Reserve Corps. COVID-19 will not only be the last pandemic. We need to create a National Disease Prevention and Management Authority to better respond to future outbreaks. We count on Congress\u2019 full support. You can just let it remain for a while in the Department of Health kung wala pang pera but you have to expand the services or it will also entail a little bit of money but not really as much as expensive when you set up a department. In the long term, we are looking into the creation of the National Disease Prevention and Management Authority to better prepare for pandemics, protect lives, and allow development to proceed even in the worst of times. We are counting on the full support of Congress for this critically important endeavor. I don\u2019t know but I\u2019ll leave it to Congress to really\u2026 It\u2019s another department. There seems that it could be a multilayer redundant thing between the health and the proposed department. I call on Congress to prioritize the passage of a law for the Unified System of Separation, Retirement and Pension of the Military and Uniformed Personnel without however diminishing the benefits that our uniformed personnel are entitled to under existing laws. [applause] There is a need to adjust the pension system which will be applicable only to newly-hired uniformed personnel so as not to cause a \u201cballooning effect\u201d against the budget of the military in the years to come and yet maintain the pension benefits of those already in service under the present law. This issue needs a solution now. Umpisahan natin ngayon para hindi na maging problema sa susunod na mga taon. I want to\u2026 You know one of the\u2026 This is not politicking, I am not running. I cannot run anymore. Iyong dinoble ko \u2018yung suweldo ng pulis pati army it was really a clarion call para for them also to have a decent life and they are able to get the things which ordinarily cannot be reached by any government employee. Ang akin doon is \u2018yung corruption that maybe it might be a vain attempt but maybe dagdagan ang suweldo para it would be a hedge against corruption. We must also modernize the Bureau of Fire Protection and the Bureau of Immigration with urgency. Alam mo sa Davao and if you go there I can show you, one of the serviceable trucks, fire trucks that we have in the City of Davao\u2026 Of course ang city mayroon ng sarili aside from the Bureau of Fire --- Bureau of Fire which is really national, mayroon 'yung Bureau of Fire. Would you believe it? Serviceable still. Ang pangalan ng truck, Studebaker. Ang katawan --- ang talagang matatag ang katawan. Kaya ang makina, Isuzu. [laughter] Pero okay pa rin. It can put out fire. Totoo. This is how this Bureau of Fire issue na medyo na --- na-overlook natin nang matagal.  I emphasize the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. Our people\u2019s safety cannot be delegated to a council or commission. Equally important is the establishment of evacuation centers in every city, province and municipality throughout the country. We must act [now] before another major disaster shakes [us] into action. The problem is disaster and even a fire cannot be --- make --- they cannot make a study for projection when the earthquake would suddenly come and make a big crack there. Hindi natin alam talaga. Ang ibig kong sabihin, this will require more than just one brainwork kung paano talaga itong how to prevent or avoid disaster. It will be\u2026 By the way, just before starting, I was tempted to say it pero baka magtindigan kayo. It will be all right for me if Bong Go will just stay. Wala akong problema. Kasi sabi ko na this piece of speech of mine would be one of the longest SONAs that I will deliver. Nakita ko 'yung page pagbigay sa akin. Iyong ibang input, akin. But 'yung iba lahat. Ang nangyari po, binalik ko sa kanila. \u201cMake it short.\u201d Pagbalik sa akin, mas makapal na. \"Naku, p i*.\" Eh di nandiyan na ngayon. Ito na ngayon. The responsible extraction and equitable distribution of natural resources remain among my non-negotiables. I reiterate the need for the passage of the National Land Use Act which has been pending for decades. Pakisilip lang ho ninyo 'yan. For the rest of my term, I hope to see concerted efforts in protecting the environment. The rehabilitation of Boracay Island showcased our resolve to safeguard the environment. [applause] Boracay is doing well because of its scenery. If it\u2019s only a coconut and a black --- white sand and water, wala \u2018yan. Pero you add the --- the visitors there, then it becomes a very tempting destination. We have seen the remarkable reemergence of the Island back to its former glory. I want this sustained. I ask Congress to enact a law creating --- importante ito --- the Boracay Island [Development] Authority or BIDA. We need it. I cannot stress enough the importance of agriculture. The growth of our economy depends on a robust agricultural sector. We must utilize the coconut --- ito, isa --- we must utilize the [coco levy funds] for the welfare our coconut farmers and the development of our coconut industry. I urge everybody --- both of the Executive Department pati ito --- that ito 'yung pera na nakuha doon sa na-sequester. And itong perang malaking ito, gagamitin ito for the welfare of the farmers. The problem is, we can no longer trace who are the farmers of yesterday. Marcos was --- Marcos is a distant star. We do not know. Ako, alam ko because we had a little piece also that was covered by the land reform. Hindi na natin malaman kung sino ang may-ari. So I think Congress should look again and try to sort out how best the money can be utilized. I will not make any suggestion but I leave it to Congress to decide what to do with it.   I once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a version of the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers\u2019 Trust Fund. Tulungan natin ang ating mga magsasaka pagka hindi mawawala \u2018yang pera, bilyon \u2018yan. [applause] Jusko po. Well anyway the\u2026 We have learned so many lessons along the way. I am also requesting Congress to pass the Rural Agricultural and Fisheries Development Financing System Act. We aim to provide adequate, accessible and affordable food for every Filipino [family] through the Plant, Plant, Plant Program. [applause] After the Build, Build, Build\u2026 I think this is easier to achieve. A few good men --- a few good regional directors, DAR and the dedicated workers down below could make this thing a success. Mas madali ito kaysa Build, Build, Build. Ito Plant, Plant, Plant lang eh. It is more of a the --- well, how you try to convince the farmers to cooperate with government for their benefit. This P66-billion agricultural stimulus package will help the agriculture and fisheries sector recover. I hope so. [applause]  We need to build trust and confidence in online transactions, stronger protection for online consumers and enabling measures for online businesses is needed through the enactment of an Internet Transactions Act (ITA). [applause] This is very good. I thus direct the Department of Trade and Industry and other relevant [government] agencies to work closely with Congress in ensuring that the provisions of the proposed bill are responsive to the needs of the consumers while promoting the growth of e-Commerce in the country. [applause] If you are tired of clapping, you just say so. I can make a shortcut. [laughter] Pabilisan lang 'yan.  On the path to better governance, we travel with others. Partners \u2013 both old and new - have helped. For bolstering our antiquated public health system, for bringing home our laid off Filipinos overseas, for filling in supply gaps for crucial medical supplies and equipment and staple food, for these and many more, the Philippines thanks all friendly nations. We will never forget your kindness and your timely support. Within ASEAN and beyond, the Philippines will continue to work with partners to address global perils and ramp up cooperation to secure for our peoples, greater peace, progress and prosperity. The Filipino nation claims its rightful place in the community of sovereign states. Thus, we will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy. Let me be very clear about this. May I cut my prepared speech? Alam mo, I read a little over three weeks or last month na the Americans would --- intends to go back to Subic. I will just put on record my thoughts. I have nothing against America, I have nothing against China but if you put bases here, you will double the spectacle of a most destructive thing just like Manila during the Second World War --- during the retaking of this city. One of the most devastated cities in the world. Kaya maglagay-lagay ka ng base at this time, this will ensure if war breaks out, because there would be atomic arsenals brought in, this will ensure the extinction of the Filipino race. We worked without fail to protect our rights in the South China Sea, neither beholden nor a pawn to anyone. We broadened the boundaries of Philippine diplomacy. We built productive ties with everyone willing to engage us on the basis of equality and mutual respect. And, we redefined our relationships with our most important partners, placing the country in a far better position to advance our interests in an evolving regional order and emerging global problems. [applause] Now, plenty of critics, both sides, claim about nothing has been done to retake forcefully or physically the South China Sea. Alam mo, unless we are prepared to go to war, I would suggest that we better just call off and treat this, I said, with diplomatic endeavors. China is claiming it. We are claiming it. China has the arms, we do not have it. So, it is simple as that. They are in possession of the property. It will remain a property of a --- if you're a lawyer, property rights. They are --- it has nothing to do with the Philippine Laws of Property but it\u2019s akin to --- they are in possession. So what can we do? We have to go to war and I cannot afford it. Maybe some other president can, but I cannot. Inutil ako diyan, sabihin ko sa inyo. And I'm willing to admit it. Talagang inutil ako diyan. Wala akong magawa. I cannot\u2026 The moment I send my Marines there at the coastal shores of Palawan, tinamaan ng cruise missile lahat iyan. Hindi pa nga naka-set sail iyan eh, sabog na. Let me say again that victory in the global battle against COVID-19 would take longer than we expect. Everyone\u2019s cooperation is needed. I know that you, the Filipino people, have sacrificed a lot. But we have no other choice but to work together and to do even more. I must admit that our actions have been far from perfect --- totoo iyan I admit it --- and there could be improvements here or there\u2014but all of us in government, including myself, assure you that we will not stop until we get things right and better for you. [applause] I know that many of you are worried not only about health and safety but also about our ability to move around and ride public transportation; the depletion of your savings due to the rising cost of goods; and the loss of your incomes due to uncertainties in your jobs and livelihood. I assure you that your government will [squarely address] these problems and challenges to overcome them and proceed to the \u2018new normal\u2019. Marami ho talagang mawawalaan ng --- those for the middle-income. They buy a car on installment basis. If you cannot keep up with the amortization, you'll lose it --- you\u2019ll lose the car and you are forced to ride on public utilities. Concomitantly, didiretso rin itong mga criminal na rarami at crimes will increase. But let me assure you, for as long as I am President, there can never be a runaway crime in any of our cities. Hindi ako papayag ng ganun. I can assure you we will remain peaceful --- relatively peaceful. [applause] Hindi naman very peaceful. Pero kung sabihin mo na kagaya ng holdup dito, holdup, ah\u2026 Alam naman nila kung ano mangyayari. You know what will happen to you. I am addressing myself to the criminals. You commit holdups, you commit rapes, you commit all sorts of things and you harm the public, then kaaway mo na ako. Kapag bumalik kayo sa dati kagaya noon, patong-patong na naman ang patay dito. Sigurado hahanapin ko kayo. Do not ever go back to your old ways. Maghanap na lang kayo ng anong trabaho diyan. Magtiis kayo. To open up the economy to pre-Covid-19 levels at this time is not an option because whatever good it can produce will only be gobbled up, or be outweighed, by the bad it will generate. Sometimes, haste does make waste. The recent upsurge of infections when we opened little windows to the resumption of business is proof of that. I am happy that I have talked to you today. You know, in other places they opened up too early too soon. America is one. China --- well fortunately, it was arrested on time. China and the rest for those who opened up and those who do not follow the protocols of the --- at least the World Health Organization --- they are suffering and they have at least 140 deaths. Ang Amerika nagkukulang sila lahat. No nation on earth was really prepared for COVID. No amount of preparation because that kind of microbes visits about once every 100 years. Wala man \u2018yung --- mga tatay natin, what they suffered was Second World War, but tayo\u2026 We are not ready and therefore we will not gamble with the lives and health of the people. Certainly, no one would want to end up on the negative side of the equation. Not me, not us. All I ask is that you continue to put your faith in your government and work with us in achieving what is best for our country and our people. Together, let us do --- mahirap basahin kasi dito eh --- the most that we can to ensure that the health, safety and well-being of every Filipino\u2014especially those severely affected \u2014are taken care of. Together, we shall fight this pandemic with the same fervor as our campaign against illegal drugs, criminality, insurgency, and corruption in high places and entrenched parochial interests. As a government worker, I am addressing each and every Filipino that the government cannot do this without your help. More than ever, we need to reinvigorate the deep-seated Filipino spirit of pakisama and malasakit within each and everyone of us. We are being --- we are being tested, as a people and as a nation. Worse times loom ahead. But I do hope that this spirit of solidarity and unity will serve as the drumbeat to which we shall march in unison in our quest for the light at the end of the tunnel. I appeal to each and every Filipino, let us take care of one another. Ito ang panahon para magtulungan. Hindi ito ang panahon para maglamanan --- maglaman --- lamang-lamangan --- lamang. Mamang p*** --- dila ko. [applause]  Hindi maglamang --- at pagkakaisa. My faith in the Filipino innate patience, resilience and determination to bounce back is unwavering. Let us share our blessings with those who have little and those who have none. This is the time to bring out the best in us. The woes that weigh heavily upon our shoulders may bend our back, but they shall not bend or break our spirit. From the rubbles of adversity, a more resilient and stronger nation built on Bayanihan and Pagkakaisa shall rise. Together, we shall overcome. Before I\u2026 Pardon the time but it was really the allotted time for my speech. I would just like to give a statement between --- between us sa gobyerno kung hindi tayo nagkakaintindihan. You know Drilon, stand it --- he was defending\u2026 I would like to ask Drilon, were you a part of ACCRA when this contract of Ayala water was being drafted? And why are you fumigating? Bakit kasi ikaw lang ang galit? Na sabi mo na dynasty-dynasty. You are a hypocrite. You know that you cannot pass an anti-dynasty law. Ikaw ang nandiyan sa Congress, \u2018di ikaw ang mauna dito. But you know, to take it against me for protecting my country is something which I really resent. Alam mo you described using the dictionary the synonym ng mga oligarchs, oligarchy, kung ano, then you proceeded to characterize everyone every --- every name and then said that oligarchy is not bad at all because sa --- not all oligarchies are bad. True. But ito, to my countrymen, the oligarchy that exists in this country is the oligarchy that existed during the Spanish time. And the Spanish lands and the friar lands and all the benefits that were passed on to the Insulares who did not go back to Spain or to the Spaniards and into their\u2026 But that was long ago, it has been forgotten. This is the oligarchy that controls the Philippines by what? By taking control of the water and the electricity and power. Iyan ang oligarchy mo Drilon. [applause] Wala ng oligarchy dito except that. They have controlled. Look at\u2026 How can you now craft a new contract? Because I would insist that you pay the billions and billions that you collected. For example, water treatment. O nandiyan sa kontrata. It\u2019s in the billing, they are being collected since 1997. Ilang bilyon na nga wala ni isa, not even a faucet was built for a water treatment facility. Iyan ang mahirap sa\u2026 You do not protect the oligarchs here. You are the one. Ikaw lang mag-isa. And I suspect that you were also the one --- or helped when you were there in the ACCRA. We do not even know the --- ang mga abogado sa public documents hindi nga alam. Hindi nga natin alam kung naka-graduate ba o hindi. Wala. Would you think Ayala would get the services of those\u2026? Ayala got ACCRA. ACCRA did it. Ikaw galing ka doon, most of you, more successful lawyers sa corporation, you handle big corporate. Iyan ang mahirap. Bangga tayo dito. Me, hinawakan ninyo eh. Hindi ka puwede kay\u2026 Kita mo noong nag-increase, walang tubig, pinuputol \u2018yung tubig, ang tao bumigay kasi hindi puwede man tayo hindi maligo, hindi uminom. Electricity ayaw mo mag-increase. O ayan, wala ka, palaging brownout, lahat. I\u2019m sorry but I have to say this to you. I do not like it. It\u2019s not the time for it, but since it is the time for the SONA, for people to know and people to really get the facts, then --- and the right of the people to be heard. Tayo na naman ang tao magsabi. Hinawakan ninyo \u2018yang tubig pati electricity, iyon ang oligarchy talaga. Kaya ako sinabi ko noong kampanya \u201ccorruption is not here.\u201d Iyang mga Customs na \u2018yan, maliit \u2018yan. It\u2019s there upstairs. And I was really --- and providential, dumating \u2018yung panahon na hindi ko hiningi. Then I saw the contract.

Thank you for your courtesy. Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the members of the Senate; House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; Former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo; His Excellency Gabriele Caccia and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; Acting Chief Justice Antonio Carpio and the justices of the Supreme Court; my fellow workers in government; mga kababayan. About two years ago, I solemnly took my oath as a worker of the national government. I was as inspired to institute real changes for the greater good of the Filipino people, as I was greatly overwhelmed then by the daunting challenges that lay ahead. Two years later, my solid commitment to directly and decisively address our nation\u2019s collective challenges remains. It has not wavered. In truth, it has even gotten stronger through adversity and the desire to give the people the most we can, within my term in this government. Let me begin by putting it bluntly: the war against illegal drugs is far from over. Where before, the war resulted in the seizure of illegal drugs worth millions of pesos, today, they run [into] billions in peso value. I can only shudder at the harm that those drugs could have caused had they reached the streets of every province, city, municipality, barangay and community throughout the country. This is why the illegal drugs war will not be sidelined. Instead, it will be as relentless and chilling, if you will, as on the day it began. These drug dealers know fully well that their business is against the law. They know the consequences of their criminal acts, especially when caught in flagrante delicto and they violently resist arrest. They know that illegal drugs waste away lives, dysfunctionalize families, and ruin relationships. They know that once hooked, addicts will die slowly \u2013 slow deaths. And yet, they persist in doing what they do, oblivious to the terrible harm that they cause to the people and communities. And when illegal drug operations turn nasty and bloody, advocates of human rights lash at \u2013 and pillory \u2013 our law enforcers and this administration to no end. Sadly, I have yet to hear really howls of protest from the human rights advocates and church leaders against drug-lordism, drug dealing and drug pushing as forceful and vociferous as the ones directed against the alleged errant [law] enforcers in the fight against this social scourge. If you think that I can be dissuaded from continuing this fight because of [your] demonstrations, your protests, which I find, by the way, misdirected, then you got it all wrong. [applause] Your concern is human rights, mine is human lives. [applause] The lives of our youth are being wasted and families are destroyed, and all because of the chemicals called shabu, cocaine, cannabis, and heroine. Human rights to me means giving Filipinos, especially those at the society\u2019s fringes, a decent and dignified future through the social and physical infrastructures necessary to better their lives. The lives and freedoms and the hard-earned property of every Filipino whose condition we wish to improve shall be protected from criminals, terrorists, corrupt officials, and traffickers [of] contrabands. You worry about the present; I am concerned [about] both the present and the future. [applause] I worry about the future because I know what crimes can do to the youth of this country. If not stopped, crimes can make human cesspools of succeeding generations. I will not allow it to happen. Not during my term. [applause] Time and again, I have stressed that corruption must stop. [applause] Corruption is like a leech that it bleeds the government of funds programmed for its infrastructure and other social development projects. It saps the morale or the morale of dedicated and honest government workers. Corruption destroys those who succumb to its temptation and eventually it is the innocent who will suffer and bear its horrible consequences. The love of money is corrosive. And sadly, the desire to make the easy kind by being imaginative and manipulative, corrupts absolutely. Stolen wealth does not make the thief respectable. Neither will the trappings of wealth mask [nor] cap the stink that thievery exudes. One day, justice will catch up with those who steal government funds. And when that day comes, it will be the public who will have its retribution. While we run after those who steal the people\u2019s money, we are also enhancing the government\u2019s delivery of frontline services. I thank Congress for the swift passage of the Ease of Doing Business [Act], [applause] which is a significant fight against corruption and improving service delivery. We need to sustain our momentum. And I hereby direct all local government units \u2013 makinig sana kayo \u2013 and government agencies to faithfully implement this law and simply simplify the process. Hinihingi ko ho \u2018yan sa lahat nasa gobyerno under my control and supervision. Huwag ho kayong magkamali. I particularly call the attention of the agencies with the [most] number of red tape-related reports from the public, make your services truly customer-friendly. Our people deserve efficient, effective, and responsive government services. They deserve nothing less. [applause] Kayo lang ang ayaw eh. Gusto ng tao kayo \u2018yung binabayaran, make your living from the pockets of the people and you have a lousy and corrupt bureaucracy. I have friends and political supporters whom I appointed to public office and then dismissed or caused to resign. I need not mention their names or recount the circumstances surrounding their removal or resignation. Media has more than amply reported that. I value friendship, make no mistake about it. But it has its limits. This is a lonely place I am hemmed in. Do not make it lonelier by forcing me to end our friendship because you gave me the reason to end it. It pains me to end \u2013 the loss of friendships. And that is why I appeal to you to help me in my cause so that our friendship will endure. For as long as I can remember, the bulk of the income generated in Mindanao used to be remitted to what we, in Mindanao, refer [to] as the \u201cImperial Manila\u201d to fund national projects primarily in the Metro Manila area, leaving a pittance to Mindanao as its share thereof.Mindanao was dubbed as \u201cThe Land of Promise,\u201d and Mindanaoans say in derision that this is so because what it got from the government through the years were promises, promises and more promises. We aim to rectify that derisive observation and, as a matter of fact, we are now in the process of fulfilling that promise through significant increases in the budget for Mindanao. At the end of my term, I hope to see the promise of Mindanao fulfilled, or at the very least, approaching fulfilment. Be that as it may, Mindanao pauses at the crossroads of history. One road leads to harmony and peace; the other, to war and human suffering. Despite all that has been said [for] or against the Bangsamoro Organic Law by all sectoral groups, I make this solemn commitment that this administration will never deny our Muslim brothers and sisters the basic legal tools to chart their own destiny within the Constitutional framework of our country. When the approved version is transmitted and received by my office\u2026 The law has been passed actually and I intend to\u2026 Give me 48 hours to sign it and ratify the law. [applause] Babasahin ko pa bago ko pipirmahan. Baka may isiningit kayo diyan na hindi maganda para sa \u2013 para sa ibang tao. We will need loads of understanding and patience to endure and overcome the birth pangs or pains of the new beginning. To me, war is not an option. We have been through the catastrophe in Marawi. We have seen the horror, the devastation, and the human toll and the displacement of both Christians and Muslims alike. I have made a pledge that ISIS terrorists or groups or its allies will never gain foothold in our country. Yet, when what remained of the decimated Maute-ISIS group in Marawi finally saw the error of their ways and expressed their desire to be reintegrated into society, we welcomed them with open arms and embarked on genuine efforts to embrace a peaceful, productive life for them. We owe it to our fallen soldiers and police officers in Marawi and elsewhere to put an end to the bloodshed and seek the path of true peace\u2014a peace that will last beyond this lifetime, and whose dividends our children will reap. On international relations, we shall continue to assert and pursue an independent foreign policy. Our long-term national development and national security goals come first. We shall continue to reach out to all nations regardless of their prevailing political persuasions or proximity to or distance from our shores so long as these nations wish us well. Our stronger bonds with our ASEAN friends have made possible our trilateral border patrols with Indonesia and Malaysia, which has since then put out of business sea pirates, piracy and other terrorists who used to infest our shared seas. This is a testament to the readiness of our country and our good neighbors to make regional peace and security our shared responsibility. We have successfully hosted the 50th ASEAN Anniversary and the 31st ASEAN Summit last November 2017. We have shown the world what we are capable of when we work together. The ASEAN events showcased not only the world-renowned Filipino hospitality and organizational capabilities but also our artistic talent. I would like to commend the [ASEAN National] Organizing Council led by no less than my Executive Secretary, Salvador Medialdea. [applause] Our re-energized relations with China has also led to an unprecedented level of cooperation between our nations on the war against transnational crimes. Our shared intelligence led to the discovery and dismantling of the clandestine shabu laboratories and the arrest of Chinese chemists [connected] with the Dragon organization called Wu Syndicate. Our improved relationship with China, however, does not mean that we will waver in our commitment to defend our interests in the West Philippine Sea. [applause] This is why we engage China through bilateral and multilateral platforms such as the ASEAN-China and the Philippines-China Bilateral Consultation Mechanism. Opening lines of communication and amicably managing differences have led to positive developments that include renewed access of Filipino fishermen in the areas in dispute in the Philippines \u2013 West Philippine Sea. Participation in the ASEAN-China dialogue has also resulted to the draft framework for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea which intends to resolve disputes by peaceful means. We admire our Filipino migrant workers for their selflessness and courage in enduring the hardships of living away from home to provide for their families. You epitomize the innate resilience of the nation. You have shown your willingness to toil and sacrifice day-in and day-out, for the long-term good of your family and loved ones. You have also contributed greatly to the national economy, even as you help in small and big ways to the economies of our international partners. This is why we strongly condemn the deaths and abuses experienced by Filipino migrant workers in the hands of their foreign employers. I have said this before and I say it again: I am a worker of government, and it is my vow to make sure that your well-being remains our foremost foreign policy concern. [applause] It is for this reason that we are continuing to work with the host nations to ensure the welfare of our countrymen. I appeal to all host governments to help us, as true and dependable partners, in this endeavor. I have always believed that no matter how well-intentioned a leader is, no matter how well-conceived may be his mission, if he lacks the political will to do what needs to be done, then he can only end up a failure and a hopeless dreamer. As a worker of government, I promised to do whatever it would take to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, fighting powerful interests and making sacrifices. My obligation is to promote and uphold the greatest good, for the greatest number. [applause] Our campaign against Endo has resulted in the regularization of more than 300,000 workers as of early this month. OnMay 1of this year, I signed Executive Order 51, which sought to protect the workers right to security of tenure. Read my lips, I understand that this does not satisfy all sectors. I share their sentiment; I truly do. Much as I would like to do the impossible, that power is not vested upon me by the Constitution. And neither will I make both ends meet even if I violate the laws to achieve that purpose. Simply, it is not part of my territory. That is why I add mine to their voices in asking Congress to pass legislation ending the practice of contractualization once and for all. [applause] Our farmers, especially our coconut farmers, form a significant part of the basic sectors of society. It is from the toil of their hands that we put food on the table. It is my hope that we finally see this through. I urge you Congress to convene the [bicameral] conference committee and pass at the soonest possible time the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers\u2019 Trust Fund. [applause] I pray that you will do it. My administration remains firm in its resolve to ensure that the country\u2019s telecommunications services are reliable, inexpensive and secure. A draft Terms of Reference for the entry of a new, major industry player is at hand. The terms will be fair, reasonable and comprehensive. It will be inclusive so it will be open to all interested private parties, both foreign and local. The only condition is that the chosen entity must provide the best possible services at reasonably accessible prices. However, our efforts to usher in a new major player shall be rendered futile if we do not improve its odds of success in an industry that has long been dominated by a well-entrenched duopoly. We shall, therefore, lower interconnection rates between all industry players. Not only to lessen the cost to the consumers as it will also lower the costs [for the] incoming player to access existing networks, [thereby creating] a market environment that is more conducive to competition. This is a policy which is crucial to ensure that our solution to our telecommunication problems will be both meaningful and lasting. In the last 2 years, experience has taught me that lack of consultation or insufficiency of information can, at times, lead to rash judgments. If and when I am unsure on the most appropriate course of action to take given the problem, it\u2019s factual milieu and the desired end, I never fail to consult to discuss options with persons whom I trust and whose advise I value. When I decided to establish Malasakit Centers in Cebu, Tacloban and Iloilo, my long-time aide, Bong Go and his team became instrumental in arriving at the right decision through proper consultations. [applause] Deliberations with the proper agencies also made me decide to push for, and eventually approve, both the [free] Tertiary Education Act and the increase in the salary of our men in uniform, our soldiers and our policemen. [applause] Boracay Island, widely regarded as one of our country\u2019s treasures and admired worldwide for its natural beauty, has sadly become the representation of the government\u2019s negligence, including mine. I could not allow this decay to continue; decisive action has long been overdue. Recognizing that we are mere stewards of our natural resources, and I said enough is enough. We intend to restore its environmental integrity, alongside measures to alleviate those whose livelihood were momentarily affected.Environmental protection and ensuring the health of our people cannot be overemphasized; thus, our actions in Boracay mark the beginning of a new national effort. This is just [the beginning]. For the other tourist destinations needing urgent rehabilitation and enforcement of environmental and other laws shall soon follow. I urge our local government units to proactively enforce our laws and not wait for us to swoop down on your areas just to do your duty and work. [applause] Some other time I would have to discuss sa local government units. What has happened to Boracay is just an indication of the long-overdue need to rationalize, in a holistic and sustainable manner, the utilization, management, and development of our lands. I therefore urge the Senate to urgently pass the National Land Use Act [applause] to put in place a national land use policy that will address our competing land requirements for food, housing, businesses, and environmental conservation. We need to do this now. To help safeguard the present and the future generations, we have to earnestly undertake initiatives to reduce our vulnerabilities to natural hazards, and bolster our resilience to the impact of natural disasters and climate change. As I had stated last year, we must learn from the experiences from the Super-typhoon Yolanda, and other mega disasters, and from global best practices. We need a truly empowered department characterized by a unity of command, science-based approach and full-time focus on natural hazards and disasters, and the wherewithal to take charge of the disaster risk reduction; preparedness and response; with better recovery and faster rehabilitation. Hence, we, in the Cabinet, have approved for immediate endorsement to Congress the passage of a law creating the \u201cDepartment of Disaster Management,\u201d [applause] an inter-agency --- just like FEMA. Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s --- it\u2019s an effective agency in the United\u2019s government. An inter-agency crafted and a high-priority measure aimed at genuinely strengthening our country\u2019s capacity for [resilience] to natural disasters. I fervently appeal to Congress to pass this bill with utmost urgency. Our people\u2019s safety requirements cannot wait. Ours is a rich and beautiful country, indeed. Add to that a great number of people equipped with technical expertise and professionalism, and you have a country poised to soar and take its place among the world\u2019s economic and financial eagles. God willing. Inshallah. Nature endowed us with this wealth to be tapped for the benefit of all generations. My policy in the utilization of these resources is non-negotiable: the protection of the environment must be top priority [applause] and extracted resources must be used for the benefit of the Filipino people, [applause] not just a select few. Do not just give me taxes. I can get it from other sources. Give me what needs to be given to my countrymen. [applause] To the mining industry, I say this once again and maybe for the last time, do not destroy the environment or compromise our resources; repair what you have mismanaged. Try to change [your] management radically because this time you will have restrictive policies. The prohibition of open pit mining is one. [applause] It is destroying my country. It is destroying the environment. It will destroy the world oftomorrowfor our children. [applause] Again, I warn irresponsible miners, along with their patrons, to stop destroying our watersheds, recharge areas, forests, and aquatic resources. You can no longer fish in our rivers. It\u2019s all contaminated. And the color is not even brown or white, it\u2019s black. You want to see it? I will invite you. We can go to Diwalwal and the other mining areas. And I\u2019m sure you will puke with what is happening to this country. Expect reforms, radical ones. I cannot intend to quarrel with anybody, with the moneyed, but for as long as I am here I said: you will just have to contend with me. I expect you to do your part in ensuring our nation\u2019s sustainable development, starting now. I exhort all concerned agencies and local government units to uphold the concept of inter-generational responsibility in [the exploration] and utilization of our mineral wealth, the protection and preservation of our biodiversity, anchored on the right to a balanced and healthy ecology. I applaud Congress for the timely passage of the TRAIN law. You have made funds available to build better roads and bridges, and improve health and education, and strengthen our safety and security. Some have incorrectly blamed our efforts toward a fairer tax system for all the price increases in the past months, and some irresponsibly suggesting to stop TRAIN\u2019s implementation. We cannot and should not. We need this for sustainable growth that leaves no Filipino left behind. TRAIN is already helping poor families and senior citizens cope up with rising prices. We have distributed unconditional cash transfers to 4 million people, and we will help 6 million more this year. Following the one-peso discount per liter in gas stations, we have also started releasing fuel vouchers to public utility jeeps and other valid franchises. Further, we have fast-tracked the distribution of NFA rice to provide affordable rice for all. [Excuse me.] This year, we are giving 149 billion pesos worth of subsidies to the poor and vulnerable. Next year, the amount will be increased to 169 billion pesos. But no amount of subsidy can help the poor if some businesses take advantage of the situation to make more money. I ask businesses to cooperate with us in charging a fair price. To help stabilize rice prices, we also need to address the issue of artificial rice shortage. I now ask all the rice hoarders, cartels and their protectors, you know that I know who you are: stop messing with the people. I hate to\u2026 Power sometimes is not a good thing. But I hope I will not have to use it against you. Consider yourselves warned; mend your ways now or the full force of the State shall be brought to bear upon you. I am directing all intelligence agencies to unmask the perpetrators of this economic sabotage and our law enforcement agencies to bring them to justice. We are also working on long-term solutions. On top of this agenda to lower the price of rice. We need to switch from the current quota system in importing rice to a tariff system where rice can be imported more freely. This will give us additional resources for our farmers, reduce the price of rice by up to 7 pesos per kilo, and lower inflation significantly. I ask Congress to prioritize this crucial reform, which I have certified as urgent today. Alam mo, ako humihingi talaga ng tulong. Business is really for profit I understand that. But the Philippines has always been a playground for, you know, scoundrels and those who do it without really considering the plight of the others. It\u2019s all conscience. When I ran for public office, I promised to do whatever it takes to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, even if it means fighting powerful interests. I am committed to a comprehensive tax reform, and I ask Congress to continue the job. Package 2 will lower corporate income taxes, especially for our small businesses. Lower taxes mean they will have more money to invest and create more jobs. More than 99 percent of our businesses are micro, small, or medium enterprises (MSME) and employ around 65 percent of our workers. The enactment of the Package 2 is what stands between today and millions of jobs in the near future. Congressmen Cua, Gonzales, Abu, and Garin and Batocabe, as well as the Suansing family, filed versions of Package 2 last March 2018. Salamat po [applause] and I support their push to shepherd the bill. I hope the Senate will follow suit, maybetomorrow, sir. This matter is urgent. Do not be part of the problem by ignoring it. I hope to sign Package 2 before the year ends. I urge Congress to pass it in a form that satisfies our goals and serves [applause] the interests of the many, not just the wealthy few. By the end of July 2018, all 5 packages of my tax reform would have been submitted to Congress. Apart from TRAIN, rice tariffication, and Package 2, they include the mining, alcohol, and tobacco tax increase, reform in property valuation, reform in capital income and financial taxes, and an amnesty program. I urge Congress to take them seriously and pass them in succession, for there is no chance that we can deliver our promises without an equitable tax system. One of the most important thrusts of this administration's medium-term development plan is to cover all Filipinos against financial health risks. That is why I have directed concerned agencies to streamline the various sources of financial assistance for people with health-related needs. We are currently institutionalizing the unified implementation of the \"No Balance Billing Policy\" [applause] through which the government and our private healthcare providers can work out a system that will provide an order of charging of medical expenses. Much needs to be done to improve our healthcare system, which remains highly fragmented, resulting in disparity in health outcomes between the rich and the poor in the urban areas and rural. While investments in health have increased over the years, several policy and operational bottlenecks have constrained universal health care for this country. We shall pool all our resources for health services under the [PhilHealth]; institutionalize primary care as a prerequisite to access higher level of healthcare; and supplement human resource gaps of the LGUs through a National Health Workforce Support System. These will ensure that every Filipino family gets the appropriate, affordable, and quality health services in appropriate facilities and will be protected from financial burden due to sickness. To this end, I urge the speedy passage of the Universal Health Care Bill authored by Former Representative Harry Roque. [applause] Strong political determination, not political ambition, is the guiding light. [applause] I have no illusions of occupying this office one day longer than what the Constitution under which I was elected permits; or under whatever Constitution there might be. Four administrations before me have all tried to amend the Constitution to be able to introduce amendments and reservations to the charter \u2013 revisions rather to the charter. But none of them was successfully done for one reason or another. I therefore consider it a distinct honor and privilege to have received earlier from the Consultative Committee that I created, the draft Federal Constitution that will truly embody the ideals and aspirations of all the Filipino people. [applause] I thank all the members of the Committee, especially those who came out from their retirement, for their valuable services in crafting this draft Federal Constitution. I would like to extend my particular gratitude to Former Chief Justice Reynato Puno [applause] and Former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. [applause] I am confident that the Filipino people will stand behind us as we introduce this new fundamental law that will not only strengthen our democratic institutions, but will also create an environment where every Filipino\u2014regardless of social status, religion, or ideology \u2013 will have an equal opportunity to grow and create a future that he or she can proudly bequeath to the succeeding generations. My countrymen, I will not bore you with a litany of this administration\u2019s projects completed otherwise in the process. That would be too self-serving. I have instead caused to be prepared a written report on what has \u2013 what was and what has been done in the months and probably in the years to come. The reports shall be made available within the next few days. I was informed that satellite facilities were set up by the Presidential Communications Operations Office in certain far flung barangays so as of today the residents of these communities can watch the State of the Nation and for the first time see you on TV. I hope you have enjoyed the experience. [applause] In ending, may I quote --- I have always quoted but --- in my previous talks. One American that I salute, the great Abraham Lincoln. And this has been --- I\u2019ve been in government for the last\u2026 If I completed my\u2026 If I complete my term, Inshallah, God willing, I would have served government for 40 years. And I came across this statement which has been with me since I was a fiscal in the 70s. And he said: If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop, the presidency, might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how\u2014the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is --- what has been said against me won\u2019t amount to anything. But if the end brings me out wrong, ten angels of God swearing that I was right would make no difference. Daghang salamat ka ninyong tanan.

Duterte dropped a bombshell by raising, in an unprecedented move, the Philippines' legal victory against China in a UN forum. \"The Award is now part of international law, beyond compromise and beyond the reach of passing governments to dilute, diminish or abandon,\" he declared. Duterte also blasted groups that have \"weaponized human rights,\" as the Philippines faces criticism from no less than the UN human rights chief over drug war killings.  At the same time, the President called for \"coordinated international plans and efforts\" to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. He also warned against \"word wars\" deteriorating into real wars of nuclear weapons and missiles.  Below is the full text of Duterte's pre-recorded speech at the 75th UN General Assembly.  Mr President of the United Nations General Assembly;Mr Secretary-General;Heads of state and government;Excellencies: I am honored to address you today on behalf of the Filipino people on the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. The invisible enemy that is COVID-19 has brought about an unfamiliar global landscape and unleashed a crisis without precedent. It is the biggest test the world and the United Nations faced since World War II. While the United Nations has brought relief and hope to so many countries and peoples around the world, it now finds itself saddled by a virus that has taken many lives and wrecked economies and social order. We are at a crossroads. How we address COVID-19 will define our future. For the Philippines, this means putting up all of the peoples of our united nations at the core of this response. We will need to ask hard and fundamental questions about the vision and mission that the United Nations conceptualized 75 years ago. We need to ask ourselves whether or not we have remained true and faithful to the United Nations' principles and ideals. Mr President: In the light of the realities of the present, the Philippines grieves with all of the families all over the world who lost their loved ones to this horrible virus.  We extend our heartfelt condolences.  We salute all frontliners who put their lives on the line even in countries not their own. So also do we honor and recognize the healthcare professionals who selflessly answered the call to combat the COVID-19 pandemic despite its virulence and unknown characteristics.  While each nation has its own strategy in fighting the pandemic, what the world needs are coordinated international plans and efforts to pursue a common purpose.  COVID-19 knows no border. It knows no nationality. It knows no race. It knows no gender. It knows no age. It knows no creed.  The Philippines values the role that the United Nations plays in its fight against the pandemic. As a middle-income country whose economic advances have been derailed by the pandemic, we welcome the launch of the UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund.  Ensuring universal access to anti COVID-19 technologies and products is pivotal in the global pandemic recovery.  The world is in the race to find a safe and effective vaccine.  When the world finds that vaccine, access to it must not be denied nor withheld. It should be made available to all, rich and poor nations alike, as a matter of policy.  The Philippines joins our partners in the ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement in raising our collective voice: the COVID-19 vaccine must be considered a global public good. Let us be clear on this.  We call for a global health agenda with enough resources and policy space for the World Health Organization.  We need a WHO that is quick to coordinate and quicker to respond. The Philippines will do its part in the pooling of global resources. Our health workers are among the best. Mr President: Just as we needed stability and confidence because of the pandemic, geopolitical tensions continue to rise. Escalating tensions benefit no one. New flashpoints heighten fears and tend to tear peoples apart. When elephants fight, it is the grass that gets trampled flat. Given the size and military might of the contenders, we can only imagine and be aghast at the terrible toll on human life and property that shall be inflicted if the \"word war\" deteriorates into a real war of nuclear weapons and missiles. I therefore call on the stakeholders in the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, the Middle East and Africa: if we cannot be friends as yet, then in God's name, let us not hate each other too much. I heard it once said, and I say it to myself in complete agreement. Mr President: Filipino migrant workers have been devastated by the pandemic. Many have lost not only their livelihood, but also their health and lives as well. Yet they go on in the frontlines, healing, caring for others in different parts of the world. The Philippine government has embarked on an unprecedented repatriation program. More than 345,000 overseas Filipino workers needed to come home then. We have brought back half and are bringing back the rest. We thank the countries that have provided Filipino migrants with residence permits, access to testing, treatment, and related health services in this pandemic. We brought back most of our seafarers who were stranded because of COVID-19 restrictions. We pioneered with the IMO the Green Lane for safe changes of seafaring crews. In these times, we need stronger cooperation in promoting and protecting the rights of migrants, regardless of their migrant status. We must all adhere to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Unless states include all migrants in their response to this pandemic, \"no one among us is safe, until everyone is safe,\" as the secretary-general has said. With the poverty rate reduced at 16.6%; and a sustained economic growth rate of 6.4% between 2010 and 2019, the Philippines was on track to becoming an upper-middle income country by the end of 2020. But the pandemic has placed our economy in recession. Despite this downward pressure on growth, the Philippines remains committed to the Sustainable Development Goals. Mr President: The same urgency needed to fight COVID-19 is needed to address the climate crisis. This is a global challenge that has worsened existing inequalities and vulnerabilities from within and between nations. Climate change has worsened the ravages of the pandemic. Peoples in developing countries like the Philippines suffer the most. We cannot afford to suffer more. The Philippines joined the Paris Agreement to fight climate change. We call on all parties, especially those who have not made good their commitment to fight climate change, to honor the same. We call on all parties to strengthen communities and peoples for preparedness and resilience. We are talking about mankind and Earth, our one and only home. Mr President: The Philippines will continue to protect the human rights of its people, especially from the scourge of illegal drugs, criminality, and terrorism. A number of interest groups have weaponized human rights; some well-meaning, others ill-intentioned. They attempt to discredit the functioning institutions and mechanisms of a democratic country and a popularly elected government which in its last two years still enjoys the same widespread approval and support. These detractors pass themselves off as human rights advocates while preying on the most vulnerable humans; even using children as soldiers or human shields in encounters. Even schools are not spared from their malevolence and anti-government propaganda. They hide their misdeeds under the blanket of human rights but the blood oozes through. To move forward, open dialogue and constructive engagement with the United Nations is the key. But these must be done in full respect of the principles of objectivity, noninterference, non-selectivity and genuine dialogue. These are the fundamental bases for productive international cooperation on human rights. Mr President: Terrorism looms large.  As I said at the Aqaba Process, the Philippines will do everything and partner with anyone who would sincerely desire to protect the innocent from terrorism in all its manifestations.  The Marawi siege, where foreign terrorist fighters took part, taught us that an effective legal framework is crucial. Our 2020 Anti-Terrorism Act shores up the legal framework by focusing on both terrorism and the usual reckless response to it.  Its enactment was done pursuant to our commitment and the strict adherence to the relevant Security Council resolutions and the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  Most importantly, we remain committed to rebuild stricken communities and address the root causes of terrorism and violent extremism in my country.  We must remain mindful of our obligations and commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and as amplified by the 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes.  The Philippines affirms that commitment in the South China Sea in accordance with UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral Award.  The Award is now part of international law, beyond compromise and beyond the reach of passing governments to dilute, diminish or abandon.  We firmly reject attempts to undermine it.  We welcome the increasing number of states that have come in support of the award and what it stands for \u2013 the triumph of reason over rashness, of law over disorder, of amity over ambition. This \u2013 as it should \u2013 is the majesty of the law.  Mr President: The global health crisis has further complicated the global security environment. But no aspiration nor ambition can justify the use of weapons that destroy indiscriminately and completely.  There is no excuse for deaths that a nuclear war could cause nor the reckless use of chemical and biological weapons that can cause mass destruction.  These weapons of death put us all at mortal risk, especially if they fall in the hands of terrorists without a shred of humanity in their souls. We call on all Member States to fully implement the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the Chemical and the Biological Weapons Conventions. I have asked the Philippine Senate to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Importantly, we were among those to sign it first. Mr President: The Philippines has a long history of opening its doors to the refugees \u2013 from the White Russians following the 1917 Revolution, the European Jews in the Second World War, the Vietnamese in the late 1960s, and the Iranians displaced by the 1979 revolution, among others. The Philippines continues to honor this humanitarian tradition in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol.  But lest we forget: helping the most vulnerable \u2013 those displaced by conflict, persecution, and political instability \u2013 is a shared responsibility of all countries. As I have said many times: The doors of the Philippines are open, as they have always been, to everyone fleeing for safety, such as the Rohingyas. In the face of a mounting refugee crisis worldwide, let us work together towards ending the conflicts and conditions that force people to flee their homes. Mr President: As our societies become more diverse yet interdependent, social cohesion issues come to the fore. Mutual understanding always accompanied by mutual tolerance between those of different faiths and cultures is the only foundation of societies at peace with itself and all others. Finally, I express gratitude to the gallant peacekeepers, including our own, who advance the cause of peace in the most difficult situations. From the Golan Heights in the Middle East to Liberia in West Africa, Filipino peacekeepers put themselves in the frontlines between the vulnerable and those who seek harm. We are committed to increasing the Philippine footprint in UN peacekeeping operations with increased participation of women. Again Mr President: To defeat the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges, we must work with seamless unity which demands complete mutual trust and the conviction that we will win or lose together. We cannot bring back the dead but we can spare the living; and we can build back better, healthier, and more prosperous and just societies.  To this end, we rededicate ourselves to multilateralism. The UN remains humanity's essential organization. But it is only as effective as we make it.  To make significant changes, we need to be bold. We need the same collective courage that finally made the United Nations a reality 75 years ago.  We need to act on long-standing recommendations to improve the Security Council's composition and working methods; to strengthen the role of the General Assembly; and to streamline the processes and the operations of the UN.  Indeed, to be ready for the new global normal, it cannot be business as usual for the UN.  Let us empower UN \u2013 reform it \u2013 to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.  Let us strengthen it so it can fully deliver its mandate to maintain peace and security, uphold justice and human rights, and promote freedom and social progress for all.  After all, we are the United Nations.

He said Filipinos today should emulate Bonifacio for being \"patriotic, unfettered, and independent.\" Below is the full text of President Duterte's statement on Bonifacio Day: Today is an important day to commemorate and to honor the father of the Katipunan and the Great Plebeian from Tondo, Andres Bonifacio, whose life and legacy have inspired countless generations and whose actions have shaped the course of our nation\u2019s history. It was Bonifacio who dared to lead a mass action that defied the colonial rule and quelled the hunger of a people longing for change. He belongs to the league of heroes willing to lay down his life and put aside his own interests to honor the nation and defend it from its enemies. His courage and love of country served as a guiding torch in the midst of darkness. May this occasion serve as a reminder for us to live up to the spirit of Bonifacio, whose spirit remains patriotic, unfettered, and independent. Every waking day is an invitation to dedicate our lives [to] a worthy cause; to uplift the quality of life of our countrymen; and to bring back the pride and honor in our identity as a people. Our government calls on the public to get involved in community and national issues that affect our lives. May we all find strength to tap in our collective voice so that we can know ourselves better and understand our struggles in history. Let us cultivate our capacity to act united and share common aspirations for a peaceful, just, prosperous, and truly free nation. The President spent Bonifacio Dayvisiting troops who had been fighting the ISIS-linked Maute terror groupin Lanao del Sur. The hero's birth anniversary was also an occasion for protesters to gather at the People Power Monument on EDSA and in key cities across the country to hold Duterte directly accountable for the surreptitious burial of dictator Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
